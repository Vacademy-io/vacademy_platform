     * <p>Why the ordered test instead of "has any authority": in this service the principal's
     * authorities list MIXES role names (ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT, ...) with permission names
     * (whatever the institute's role -> authority mapping grants). STUDENT and PARENT roles hold
     * zero permissions in prod today, so "non-empty authorities" happens to mean staff -- but that
     * is one admin click away from changing, and a learner carrying a stray permission name must
     * still be refused. A learner can ALSO carry TEACHER: auth_service's self-signup assigns
     * {@code [STUDENT, TEACHER]} to every learner when the institute enables
     * {@code allowLearnersToCreateCourses}, so "has TEACHER" alone does not prove staff either.

     *       else it holds (an admin who is also enrolled as a learner keeps their access);</li>
     *   <li>A contains a known staff role -> allow;</li>
     *   <li>else A non-empty -> allow (a custom institute role -- these are staff by construction,
     *       learners are always enrolled with the built-in STUDENT role);</li>
