/**
 * Request body for moving leads from one lead list to another.
 *
 * <p>A "lead list" is an {@code audience} row; a lead is an {@code audience_response}. Moving is
 * therefore an update of {@code audience_response.audience_id}. Everything keyed by response id
 * — status history, follow-ups, calls, timeline, engagement — follows the row automatically.</p>
 *
 * <p>Partial success by design: colliding leads are skipped and reported rather than failing the
 * batch, because the common cases (merging two lists, re-routing a misconfigured form) collide
 * routinely and an all-or-nothing move of several thousand leads would be unusable.</p>
