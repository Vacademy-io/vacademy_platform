/**
 * GET /v1/reports/source-performance — per-source lead quality for leads SUBMITTED in the window
 * (institute TZ), RBAC-scoped, OPTED_OUT excluded.
 *
 * Row semantics:
 *   leads           — submissions in-window for this source_type
 *   connected_leads — leads with ≥1 telephony call whose status is in the institute's
 *                     connected-call status set (call matched by response_id, falling back to
 *                     user_id when the call row carries no response_id; calls themselves are
 *                     NOT date-bounded — "did we ever connect with this cohort")
 *   interested      — leads with ≥1 in-window status transition into an "interested" status key
 *   won             — leads whose profile converted in-window (conversion_status = 'CONVERTED')
 *   conversion_rate — won / leads as a 0–100 percentage (null when leads = 0)
 *   revenue         — PAID revenue (created_at in-window) from this source's converted leads
 *   spend / cpl / roi — Wave 2/3 (ad-spend ingestion); always null until spend tracking ships
