/**
 * Unauthenticated certificate verification — what a scanned QR resolves to.
 *
 * <p>Lives under {@code /admin-core-service/open/**}, the established permitAll
 * prefix (see {@code PublicBookingController}). <b>Adding a path here without
 * adding it to the permitAll list in ApplicationSecurityConfig means it stays
 * behind JWT and every scan hits a login wall.</b>
 *
 * <p>Security posture, since this is reachable by anyone:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The credential, not the number, is what proves anything. Certificate
 *       numbers are sequential, so number-only lookup would be enumerable.
 *       Either credential is accepted: the QR's long token ({@code ?t=}) or the
 *       barcode's short code ({@code ?c=}).</li>
 *   <li>A bad credential and a non-existent number both return the same 404, so
 *       probing cannot distinguish "wrong token" from "no such certificate".</li>
 *   <li>The response carries no file id, no learner id, and only a masked name.</li>
 * </ul>
