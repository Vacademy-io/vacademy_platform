/**
 * What a public certificate verification returns.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is visible to anyone holding the QR, so the field list is
 * the disclosure decision. Deliberately absent:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code fileId} — media-service turns any file id into a permanent,
 *       non-expiring public URL, so exposing it would hand out the PDF forever</li>
 *   <li>{@code userId}, email, phone — no learner identifiers</li>
 *   <li>{@code packageSessionId}, institute id — nothing to pivot from</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The learner's name is masked to initials-plus-shape. It is enough for the
 * holder to confirm the certificate is theirs and for an employer to corroborate
 * a claim, without making a harvested set of these worth anything.
