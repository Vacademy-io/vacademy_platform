/**
 * Shrinks a certificate field's font until its value fits the box the admin drew.
 *
 * <p><b>The problem.</b> The visual editor positions fields at a fixed size, but
 * the value only exists at issuance. "Alex Sample" and "Bhuvaneshwari
 * Ramachandran" go in the same box. Fields used to be emitted
 * {@code white-space:nowrap; overflow:hidden}, so the long one was sliced — and
 * because the box centres its content, the slice took characters off both ends.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix, in two halves.</b> The serialized template now wraps text and
 * clamps it to two lines. That alone stops anything overflowing the certificate,
 * but a value needing three lines would still be cut. This service closes that
 * gap: it measures the substituted value and steps the font down until it fits
 * in two lines.
 *
 * <p><b>Why here and not in CSS.</b> There is no CSS that says "shrink to fit",
 * and the PDF renderer runs no JavaScript. The renderer knows the box; only the
 * server knows the value. The serializer therefore stamps the content width onto
 * the element as {@code data-fit-width}, and this reads it back.
 *
 * <p><b>Why widths are estimated rather than measured.</b> Real metrics would
 * mean loading the actual font, which depends on what is installed in the
 * container — and a missing font throwing mid-issuance would cost a learner
 * their certificate to save a few percent of accuracy. The table below is
 * deterministic, testable without a font, and deliberately errs wide: over-
 * estimating shrinks slightly more than needed, which is safe, while under-
 * estimating would let text overflow, which is the bug being fixed.
