/**
 * Read-only queries for Course Pulse. All are bounded by the active set (rows whose
 * last_seen_at is inside the offline window), so cost scales with concurrent learners,
 * not with the size of activity_log.
 *
 * The "latest per learner" subquery uses DISTINCT ON (user_id) ordered by last_seen_at DESC,
 * so a learner with several open slide rows collapses to their most recent one. Time fields
 * are computed against now() in SQL; unquoted camelCase aliases are lower-cased by Postgres
 * and matched case-insensitively to the projection getters.

     * so the service computes KPI counts, needs-help state, ordering and the roster cap in Java.
     *
     * Struggle is signal-based, not dwell-based: wrong question/quiz answers and failing code
     * submissions ON THE CURRENT SLIDE. Passive slides (video/audio/document) have no such records,
