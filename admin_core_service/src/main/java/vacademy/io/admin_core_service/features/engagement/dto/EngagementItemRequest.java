/**
 * Authoring payload for one item.
 *
 * For QUESTION_OF_DAY the payload also carries the FORMAT:
 * {"format":"MCQ","options":[{"id":"a","text":"…"}],"correctOptionId":"a","explanation":"…"}
 * format is MCQ (default), TEXT (the learner writes an answer) or UPLOAD (the learner
 * attaches a document). Only MCQ has an answer key the server can grade; TEXT and
 * UPLOAD earn completion points and are read by the teacher in the tracking table.
 *
 * The key is stripped before the item ever reaches a learner and MCQ grading happens
 * server-side, which is what makes that format genuinely verifiable.
