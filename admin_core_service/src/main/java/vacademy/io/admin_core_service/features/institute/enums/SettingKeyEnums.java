    // that the pipeline already produces per attempt ({"adminActivityInsightsEnabled":

    // key means off. Deliberately opt-in: an institute should choose to expose AI-written
    // commentary about a learner rather than find it already exposed.

    // canViewReports permission in STUDENT_DISPLAY_SETTING, which already gates the
    // My Reports section the insights tab lives inside.

    // MCP (Model Context Protocol) server: whether an institute's staff may

    // roles may do so, and which tools are exposed
    // ({"enabled": false, "allowed_roles": ["ADMIN"], "enabled_tools": [],
    //   "role_overrides": {}}). Written here via GenericSettingStrategy; read and
    // enforced by ai_service (app/mcp/access.py), which owns the MCP server.
    // Deliberately opt-in: absence of the key means the server is off, and
    // learner roles are stripped from allowed_roles server-side regardless.
