/**
 * Read-only queries for Institute Pulse. Deliberately a separate repository from
 * {@code PulseRepository}: the batch-scoped Course Pulse queries stay byte-for-byte untouched.
 *
 * <p><b>The bound that makes this affordable.</b> Every query is anchored to the active set —
 * rows whose {@code last_seen_at} is inside the presence window, riding
 * {@code idx_activity_log_last_seen} (V404) — so cost scales with concurrent learners, not with
 * the size of {@code activity_log}. Widening from one batch to a whole institute breaks that
 * bound in two places, both fixed here rather than in SQL that merely swapped a WHERE clause:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Row multiplication.</b> Course Pulse scopes through
 *       {@code chapter_package_session_mapping.package_session_id = :batchId}. Institute-wide,
 *       a chapter mapped into several batches multiplies the learner's row and every head count
 *       silently inflates. Scoping is therefore done by learner membership via
 *       {@code EXISTS} on {@code student_session_institute_group_mapping}
 *       ({@code idx_ssigm_user_id_status}), which cannot multiply, and the content tree resolves
 *       each learner to exactly ONE path with {@code DISTINCT ON} before any grouping.
 *   <li><b>Correlated subqueries.</b> Course Pulse runs three per active learner. At 50–200
 *       concurrent that is fine; at ~2,000 institute-wide it is ~6,000 subqueries per cache miss.
 *       Struggle is computed here as grouped aggregates driven from the active set.
 * </ol>

public interface InstitutePulseRepository extends JpaRepository<ActivityLog, String> {

    /**
     * One PAGE of currently-present learners, ordered needs-attention first, PLUS the KPI counts
     * for the whole active set.
     *
     * <p><b>Why state and ordering moved into SQL.</b> They used to be derived in Java, which
     * meant materialising every present learner before capping the list — fine for one batch,
     * wasteful institute-wide. Sorting and limiting here means the payload carries only the rows
     * actually shown.
     *
     * <p><b>Why the counts are window aggregates rather than a second query.</b> The KPI strip
     * needs totals over the whole active set, not the page. A separate counting query would run
     * the same three CTEs twice. {@code COUNT(*) OVER ()} computes across all rows BEFORE the
     * LIMIT is applied, so one scan yields both the page and exact institute-wide counts — and
     * they stay correct on every page.
     *
     * <p><b>Struggle semantics differ from Course Pulse, deliberately.</b> Course Pulse counts
     * wrong answers across ALL visits to a slide and failing code submissions for all time. Both
     * are bounded here to the current presence window: for a "who needs help right now" signal
     * that is more accurate, and it is what keeps the query index-driven instead of unbounded.
     *
     * <p>Passive slides (video/audio/document) produce no tracked rows, so a learner watching a
     * two-hour video never registers as needing help.

     * <p>Institute scoping is an {@code EXISTS} on the learner's enrolment
     * ({@code idx_ssigm_user_id_status}) rather than a join through the chapter mapping — the
     * same anti-multiplication reasoning as the roster query.
     *
     * <p><b>Attendee identity needs three fallbacks.</b>
     * {@code live_session_logs.user_source_id} is not one kind of id:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>an in-app join writes our own {@code student.user_id} — resolves to a full name;
     *   <li>a public/guest join writes {@code session_guest_registrations.id} — that table has no
     *       name column, so email is the only identity available;
     *   <li>the BBB attendance sync writes the PROVIDER's external participant id
     *       ({@code w_xxxxxxxx}), which maps to nothing of ours — but the attendee's display name
     *       is embedded in {@code details} as {@code "Name | role=VIEWER"}.
     * </ol>
     * Joining {@code student} alone leaves cases 2 and 3 anonymous, which is why the feed read
     * "Unknown learner" for every provider-synced and guest attendee. Resolving the provider id
     * properly needs the SDK customerKey wiring that is still deferred.
