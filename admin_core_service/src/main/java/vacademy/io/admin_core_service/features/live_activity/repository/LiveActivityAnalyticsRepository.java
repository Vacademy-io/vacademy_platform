 * interface and these aggregates can grow without cluttering it.
 *
 * <p>Every query is scoped by institute and a time range, so each one rides
 * {@code idx_ule_inst_time} or {@code idx_ule_inst_cat_time}. None of them touch another
 * service.
 *
 * <p><b>No semicolons anywhere in these comments or queries.</b> Hibernate splices its
 * generated fetch clause in at the first {@code ;} it finds -- even inside a comment -- which
 * produces column-index errors that look nothing like their cause.
