/**
 * Institute-governed flags controlling what the learner "Past Sessions"
 * experience is allowed to show. Sourced from the {@code learnerDisplay}
 * block of the {@code LIVE_SESSION_SETTING} institute setting JSON
 * (see docs/LIVE_CLASS_PAST_SESSIONS_AND_CONTENT_LINKING_PLAN.md, section A1).
 *
 * All four flags default to {@code false} (opt-in) whenever the setting is
 * absent, malformed, or the institute has never configured it — this is a
 * server-side enforcement, not just a UI nicety, so a learner can never see
 * past-session data (or the more sensitive recordings/attendance/engagement
 * sub-blocks) by guessing the endpoint URL before an admin has opted in.
