    /**
     * One row per catalogue package session, with the bridge row and plan a
     * store page should sell it on: its open DEFAULT invite's, the link the
     * course itself is sold through.
     *
     * The catalogue scope and the tie-breaks are copied from the public v2
     * search (PackageRepository.getOpenCatalogPackageDetailV2 and
     * getCatalogPackageDetailV2), not shared with it:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>catalogue scope: packages published to the catalogue and linked to
     *       the institute, package ACTIVE, package session ACTIVE or HIDDEN,
     *       level ACTIVE (the v2 call passes exactly these);</li>
     *   <li>per session, among its ACTIVE bridge rows joined to an ACTIVE
     *       payment option and that option's ACTIVE plans: first a bridge row
     *       of an open DEFAULT invite (tag DEFAULT; status ACTIVE or unset;
     *       today inside its start and end dates, both inclusive - the rule of
     *       EnrollInviteAvailabilityUtil, on the database clock), then the most
     *       recently updated bridge row, then the cheapest plan. v2 has no
     *       first step: it shows the newest bridge row whatever its invite, so
     *       a newer scholarship or promo link sets the Courses page price but
     *       never the store's. v2 leaves exact ties to the database; here the
     *       ids break them so a sync is repeatable;</li>
     *   <li>when no open DEFAULT invite exists the newest row is returned
     *       anyway, with its invite joined regardless of tag or status, so the
     *       sync can say why the course is skipped (CatalogueSyncPlanner).</li>
     * </ul>
     * Rows come back in a stable catalogue order (course, level, session), the
     * order new mappings are appended in.
     *
     * payment_info is limited to the institute's packages (a superset of the
     * catalogue's sessions; the choice is made per session, so the extra ones
     * change nothing) rather than to the catalogue_sessions CTE itself: a bind
     * parameter inside a CTE that another CTE reads is not handled the same
     * way by every engine (H2 silently returns no rows), and this form needs
     * no such reference.
