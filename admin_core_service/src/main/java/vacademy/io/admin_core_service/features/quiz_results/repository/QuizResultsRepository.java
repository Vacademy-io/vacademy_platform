/**
 * Read-only queries behind the course-details Quiz Results tab.
 *
 * <p>These deliberately fetch <em>facts</em> (which quizzes, who attempted, what they
 * answered, what the answer key says) and leave the scoring to
 * {@link vacademy.io.admin_core_service.features.quiz_results.service.QuizResultsService}.
 * Aggregating in SQL off {@code quiz_slide_question_tracked.response_status} was the
 * obvious design and it is wrong: the quiz viewer graded client-side and its "Finish"
 * path wrote the literal placeholder {@code "SUBMITTED"} for every question until the
 * server-side scoring fix landed, so on production ~93% of stored responses carry no
 * verdict at all. A SQL SUM over that column reports a class that scored full marks as
 * having scored zero. The service re-derives the verdict from the stored answer key for
 * exactly those rows.
 *
 * <p>Two rules hold across all of them:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Latest attempt only.</b> Quizzes can be re-attemptable, so responses are read
 *       off the newest activity_log row per (learner, slide) via {@code DISTINCT ON}.
 *       Summing every attempt would credit a learner who retried until they passed with
 *       thirty answers on a ten-question quiz.
 *   <li><b>Batch-scoped.</b> A slide is shared across batches through
 *       chapter_package_session_mapping, so filtering on slide alone mixes other classes
 *       into a teacher's numbers. Every query joins the batch roster.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Unquoted camelCase aliases are lower-cased by Postgres and matched case-insensitively
 * against the projection getters.
