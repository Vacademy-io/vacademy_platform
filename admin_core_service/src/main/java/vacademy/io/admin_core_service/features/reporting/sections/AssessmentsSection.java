/**
 * Test and assessment results — the outcome data the rest of the digest lacks.
 *
 * Every other section answers whether learners turned up, studied, asked or paid.
 * This one answers whether they LEARNED anything, which is the question an
 * institute is actually judged on.
 *
 * <h3>The one section that leaves the database</h3>
 * Assessments live in assessment_service's own database, so this cannot be SQL. It
 * is a single HTTP call per document to an aggregate endpoint built for this
 * purpose. That is a deliberate exception to the SPI's "no cross-service calls"
 * rule, and it is bounded: one call, not one per learner. A failure THROWS rather
 * than returning empty, per the SPI contract — "assessment_service was
 * unreachable" and "no tests were taken" must never render identically.
 *
 * <h3>Awaiting evaluation is the actionable number</h3>
 * Scores describe the past; unevaluated attempts are work someone still owes a
 * learner. Measured at one institute: 331 of 834 attempts in a month sat in
 * PENDING or EVALUATING, which is a third of the cohort waiting on a mark. That is
 * why rows are ranked by the evaluation backlog rather than by score.
 *
 * <h3>Percentages, carefully</h3>
 * {@code student_attempt.total_marks} is what the learner ACHIEVED, not the paper's
 * maximum — the two are equal on every row — so the obvious division yields 100%
 * for everybody. The maximum comes from the paper's sections, and attempts with no
 * usable maximum, or which somehow exceed it, are excluded from the average and
 * counted separately rather than folded in. See {@code AssessmentReportingService}
 * in assessment_service for the full account.
