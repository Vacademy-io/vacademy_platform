/**
 * Doubts and queries learners raised, and whether anyone answered them.
 *
 * <h3>Why the backlog is not window-bounded</h3>
 * Every other section reports on a period. This one reports the OPEN QUEUE as it
 * stands now, and uses the window only for the flow figures (raised, resolved,
 * time-to-resolve). Restricting the queue to the window would make the section
 * useless exactly where it matters most: the pilot institute has 54 open doubts,
 * 39 of them unanswered for more than three days, and raised precisely 0 in the
 * last month. A window-bounded version emails them "nothing to report" while a
 * student's question from 404 days ago sits unanswered.
 *
 * <h3>How "answered" is decided</h3>
 * Replies are child rows ({@code parent_id}), so a root doubt with no live child
 * has had no response at all — a stronger and more useful signal than {@code
 * status}, which stays ACTIVE whether a teacher replied once or never opened it.
 * The two are reported separately for that reason.
 *
 * <h3>Quoting learner text safely</h3>
 * The quote is the point — "39 open doubts" prompts nothing, whereas "Sir what is
 * iteration can you explain me once again sir — 110 days, no reply" prompts
 * someone to go and answer it. But {@code html_text} is learner-authored HTML
 * ranging from 52 bytes to 998 KB, because images arrive inline as base64 data
 * URIs. So the snippet is cut to 4 KB, stripped of complete tags AND of a
 * trailing unterminated one (otherwise a 998 KB {@code <img src="data:...>} whose
 * closing bracket sits beyond the cut leaks raw base64 into the email), stripped
 * of any remaining 45+ character unbroken run, entity-decoded once so the
 * renderer's escaping does not double up, and finally capped for display.
