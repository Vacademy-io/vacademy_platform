/**
 * How much learning actually happened, and in which cohorts.
 *
 * Deliberately a companion to {@code InactivitySection} rather than a repeat of
 * it: that one names individual learners who went quiet, this one stays at cohort
 * level and answers "is this batch studying at all".
 *
 * <h3>Why engagement time is clamped per row</h3>
 * {@code activity_log.engaged_ms} is wall-clock time attributed to one activity,
 * and it includes tabs left open — the maximum observed is exactly 86,400,000 ms,
 * which is 24 hours to the millisecond. The tail is not a rounding error: in a
 * recent month, 135 rows of 16,329 (0.8%) carried 2,270 of the 4,837 total hours.
 * Reporting the raw sum would roughly DOUBLE every institute's learning time and
 * the number would be indefensible the moment anyone checked it. Each activity is
 * therefore capped at {@link #MAX_MS_PER_ACTIVITY} before summing.
 *
 * <h3>Why there is no per-batch hours column</h3>
 * 16% of learners are enrolled in more than one batch, and an activity row is not
 * attributable to a specific one. Summing hours per batch would therefore count
 * the same study time in several batches and the column would not add up to the
 * institute total printed above it. Participation (active of enrolled) has no such
 * problem — a learner either studied or did not, in every batch they belong to —
 * so the rows report participation, and the total hours stay a headline where they
 * are computed once per learner.
 *
 * <h3>Why dormant batches are listed separately</h3>
 * Ranking every batch worst-first fills the table with dead demo cohorts: at one
 * institute the twelve worst were all 0%, and the batches where learning was
 * genuinely thin never appeared. Batches with a pulse are ranked; batches with no
 * activity at all are listed largest-first and counted, because "175 enrolled,
 * nobody studying" is a different problem from "9 of 234 studying".
