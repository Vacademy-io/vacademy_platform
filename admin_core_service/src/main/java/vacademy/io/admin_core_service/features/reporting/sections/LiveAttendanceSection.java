/**
 * How well attended the live classes were.
 *
 * <h3>Three schema facts this query is built around</h3>
 *
 * <b>1. Occurrences, not sessions.</b> {@code live_session} is the series —
 * {@code start_time} is when the series began, so a weekly class that ran eight
 * times is one row dated eight weeks ago. The real occurrence table is
 * {@code session_schedules} ({@code meeting_date} per sitting), and it is what
 * this section iterates. Driving off {@code live_session} instead misses every
 * sitting in the window; driving off the attendance log instead (the first
 * version of this) silently drops the classes nobody attended — which are the
 * ones an admin most needs to see, and the report sorts worst-first.
 *
 * <b>2. Invitees are not attendance.</b> {@code live_session_participants} is
 * the invite list ({@code source_type} BATCH or USER), not a record of who came.
 * Attendance is {@code live_session_logs} with
 * {@code log_type='ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'}, joined on {@code schedule_id} — which
 * is populated on 100% of those rows and always resolves to a real occurrence.
 * The invite list is still needed, expanded to enrolled learners, because it is
 * the only available denominator: "12 attended" means nothing, "12 of 98" means
 * something.
 *
 * <b>3. Absence is never written.</b> Only {@code status='PRESENT'} rows exist —
 * there is no ABSENT row, so a missing row is ambiguous between "nobody came"
 * and "attendance was never captured". Reporting the second as 0% would accuse a
 * teacher of an empty room on the strength of missing data, and platform-wide it
 * is the COMMON case: of 3,587 occurrences in a recent month, 2,362 had no
 * attendance information at all. {@code last_attendance_sync_at} disambiguates —
 * synced, or has rows, means the figure is real — and this section says "not
 * recorded" rather than inventing a zero.
 *
 * <h3>Why three queries instead of one</h3>
 * The unrecorded classes are counted, then collapsed to one row per class rather
 * than listed per sitting. Listed raw they drown the report: one institute here
 * would contribute 327 consecutive identical "not recorded" lines, and Spark 81.
 * Collapsed, the same fact reads as nine rows — "Demo Day 1, 42 sittings, never
 * recorded" — which is a finding an admin can act on. The separate summary query
 * exists because the row caps would otherwise understate the totals: capped at 60
 * rows, an institute with 327 sittings reports "60 classes held".
