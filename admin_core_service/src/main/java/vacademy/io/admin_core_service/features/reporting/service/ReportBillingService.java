/**
 * What a report costs, and charging it.
 *
 * <h3>The price (business decision, 2026-08-22)</h3>
 * <b>The static report is free.</b> Only the AI analysis is billed, at
 * {@link #AI_ANALYSIS_CREDITS} credits per DOCUMENT, and only when the schedule
 * actually asks for it. Sections carry no price, so an admin is never penalised for
 * wanting to see more of their own data — the numbers come out of their own
 * database.
 *
 * "Per document" still matters for the AI charge: recipients are free (one
 * narrative sent to twenty admins is written once), while SCOPE multiplies, because
 * thirty batch reports mean thirty separate analyses. Frequency needs no multiplier
 * — daily simply runs thirty times a month.
 *
 * <h3>Charged after delivery, never before</h3>
 * A run that is skipped, empty, or fails to reach anybody must not cost anything —
 * an institute that bleeds credits to be told "nothing happened" turns reports off
 * and resents them. So the charge happens once the document has actually reached at
 * least one recipient, which makes it post-paid work and is why
 * {@code allow_negative} is the right convention here (the same one transcription
 * and call metering use): the wallet may dip below zero rather than a delivered
 * report going unbilled.
 *
 * <h3>Why a failed charge does not fail the run</h3>
 * By the time the charge is attempted the email is already in the recipient's
 * inbox. Throwing would flip the run to FAILED, and a FAILED row is retried —
 * which would re-send a report that already landed. A charge that cannot be
 * applied is therefore logged loudly and recorded as zero, because sending twice
 * is a worse failure than billing once too little.
 *
 * <h3>Double-charging</h3>
 * Handled by ai_service, not here: {@link CreditClient#deductPrecomputed} carries
 * an idempotency key which is short-circuited against
 * {@code credit_transactions.external_reference_id} (V243 partial unique). The key
 * is the run id, so a replay of the same document charges exactly once no matter
 * how many times this method is reached.
