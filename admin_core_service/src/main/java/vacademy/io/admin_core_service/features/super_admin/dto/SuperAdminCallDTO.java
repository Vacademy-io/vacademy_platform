/**
 * One AI call, as the super-admin call review needs it: who it was for, what it
 * cost us, what we billed, and enough to open the recording and the health
 * post-mortem without a second round trip.
 *
 * <p>COST IS MODELLED, not measured, and the flag says so. The voice bot does
 * not yet report its token or character usage (ai_token_usage has no voice
 * rows) and telephony_call_log.price has never been populated on a single row
 * of 9,690 — so every rupee here is duration x a rate-card row. A margin number
 * nobody can audit is worse than none, hence {@link #costIsModelled}.
