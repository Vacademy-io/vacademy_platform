/**
 * Manual "Click to AI call" — a counsellor/admin triggers an AI call for a lead.
 * Authenticated (not in the webhook allow-list); the actor becomes the call's
 * counsellor_user_id. Workflow-driven AI calls bypass this controller and go through
 * {@code AiCallNodeDispatcher}.
 *
 * <p><b>The click always joins the queue; whether it waits there depends on the fleet.</b>
 * The call is written to {@code ai_call_queue} and then dialled immediately, on this
 * request thread, if a line is actually free and this institute has nothing already
 * waiting — which is the normal case. Then the response is exactly what it always was:
 * {@code dispatched = true} with a {@code callLogId}, and a phone rings.
 *
 * <p>Only when the fleet is busy, or this institute already has calls queued, does the
 * click take its turn at the back. That response says {@code status = "QUEUED"},
 * {@code dispatched = false}, and carries the position and ETA so the UI can say when
 * rather than pretending nothing happened. A UI that reads {@code dispatched} as "did it
 * work?" needs to treat QUEUED as accepted-but-waiting.
 *
 * <p>What a manual call keeps either way: {@link CallTrigger#MANUAL}, so the
 * already-assigned / daily-cap / duplicate throttles do not apply to it and the
 * institute's calling window does not hold it back. Credit exhaustion and a deleted lead
 * still error loudly on the spot, exactly as before, rather than becoming a silent
 * deferral — see {@code AiCallQueueDrainJob.dispatchNowIfLineFree}.
