/**
 * Pre-renders an agent's FIXED lines into the voice bot's speech cache when the
 * agent is saved, so they are served from cache on call #1 rather than after the
 * cache has slowly learned them.
 *
 * <p>WHY ONLY THESE LINES. The bot's own utterances — the scripted opening, the
 * farewells, the nudge, the transfer-fail closing — never pass through the LLM,
 * are authored by an admin, and each is spoken as a standalone pipecat audio
 * context. That makes them the one class of sentence we can render ahead of time
 * without having to decide whether a caller really heard it. Everything the LLM
 * says has to earn its place in the cache the slow way, from calls that worked.
 *
 * <p>NEEDS telephony.vacademy-ai.client-secret (or VOICE_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET) on
 * admin-core — the same value the bot already holds. Blank is a SUPPORTED state,
 * not a broken one: warming simply does not happen, and the bot learns its fixed
 * lines from the first call instead, hitting from the second. All this buys is
 * moving the opening line's first hit from call 2 to call 1.
 *
 * <p>WHY IT CANNOT FAIL A SAVE. This spends money (each render is a vendor
 * synthesis) and crosses an ocean (admin core in Singapore, bot in Mumbai). An
 * admin pressing Save must never see either. Fire-and-forget, exactly like
 * {@link vacademy.io.admin_core_service.features.telephony.ivr.IvrPromptWarmer}:
 * a warm that fails simply means the first calls pay the vendor, as they do today.
 *
 * <p>ONLY THE OPENING LINE, and only when it carries no {{placeholder}}. The
 * handbacks, farewells, fillers and nudge are chosen inside the bot from the
 * agent's language, and nothing pre-warms them — they reach the cache the same
 * way an LLM sentence does, by being spoken on enough calls. So the first call
 * for a newly-enabled agent can serve the opening from cache and nothing else,
 * and an opening containing {{leadName}} means it serves nothing at all on that
 * call. That is expected, not a failure.
