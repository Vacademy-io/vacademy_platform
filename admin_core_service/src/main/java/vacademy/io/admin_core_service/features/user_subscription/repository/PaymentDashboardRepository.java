/**
 * Read-only aggregates behind the Payment Dashboard. Nothing here writes, and nothing here is
 * shared with the Manage Payments queries: those stay exactly as they are in
 * {@link UserPlanRepository}.
 *
 * <p>{@link #PAID_ROWS_CTE} is the billing summary's {@code paid} CTE (UserPlanRepository
 * getBillingSummary) with the SUM taken apart into rows: the same PAID filter, the same window on
 * {@code payment_log.created_at}, the same institute scoping (plan's invite, or an invoice of the
 * institute when no course filter is on), the same one-invoice-per-payment LATERAL. So any total
 * of its rows equals the Collected card for the same window and course filter.
 *
 * <p>Each row also carries what the dashboard slices by:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code method}: the payment_log vendor (RAZORPAY, STRIPE, MANUAL, OFFLINE, …).</li>
 *   <li>{@code source_kind}: SUB_ORG (a sub-org plan), LIVE_SESSION (a live-session payment
 *       option or live-session invoice), MANUAL (recorded by an admin — MANUAL/OFFLINE vendor or
 *       an admin invoice), otherwise ONLINE (the learner paid at a checkout).</li>
 *   <li>{@code payer_id}: the plan's learner, else the log's, else the invoice's.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Batch attribution: a plan belongs to the package sessions its enroll invite is ACTIVE for.
 * An invite covering several sessions (a bundle) splits its money evenly between them, so the
 * batch rows still add up to the total; money with no session (institute-level options, invoices)
 * lands on a null batch — "Unassigned".
 *
 * <p>As in UserPlanRepository, the SQL text carries no comments (an apostrophe or colon inside a
 * native-query comment has broken production before), and every expression that uses a named
 * parameter is grouped by position (GROUP BY 1), because Spring binds each occurrence of a named
 * parameter as its own placeholder and Postgres would not see two copies as the same expression.
