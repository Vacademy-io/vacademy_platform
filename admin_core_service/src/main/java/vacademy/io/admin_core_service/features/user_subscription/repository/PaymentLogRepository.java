  /**
   * Combined paginated query: returns payment log IDs from both regular (via user_plan/enroll_invite)
   * and admin-created invoice paths (via invoice_payment_log_mapping).
   *
   * PostgreSQL cannot determine the type of a NULL List parameter in "? IS NULL" checks, so we use
   * typed boolean flags instead: when a filter flag is true the corresponding IN clause is skipped,
   * and the list param is always a non-null sentinel (e.g. "__none__") so the JDBC binding succeeds.
   * includeInvoiceLogs is false whenever a user-plan-only filter (plan status, enroll-invite,
   * package-session) is active — those cannot apply to invoice-path logs. A `sources` filter is
   * honored inside the invoice arm against invoice.source (LIVE_SESSION, ADMIN_INVOICE, ...), so
   * live-session payments stay visible/filterable.
   *
   * <p>Free-text search matches a payment when ANY of these hit: the payer (name/email/phone,
   * pre-resolved to :searchUserIds by the caller), the amount, the number of an invoice covering
   * the payment, or the name of the plan being paid for. Each of the two subquery predicates is
   * guarded by {@code :noSearchFilter = false}, so they are constant-folded away entirely when
   * nobody is searching — an unsearched listing costs exactly what it did before. When searching,
   * both are index-driven lookups (idx_invoice_payment_log_mapping_payment_log_id and the
   * payment_plan primary key) evaluated only over rows that already passed the institute, date and
   * status filters.

  /**
   * Currency is picked the way the cards pick it: the first value that is actually a currency
   * code. `payment_log.currency` also holds blanks and junk ('string', 'N/A') from older callers,
   * and those have to fall through to the plan's or the invite's code rather than be reported as
   * the row's currency — a card drops an amount it cannot format, so taking the junk would quietly
   * lose the money instead of showing it in rupees.
   *
   * Both payment-log arms classify through the same joins on purpose. The row mapper loads
   * `paymentLog.getUserPlan()` for every row regardless of the arm it arrived on, so the arm that
   * reaches a log through an invoice has to read its plan too — otherwise it reports a different
   * status and currency for the same payment. That is also what keeps UNION de-duplicating: a log
   * with both a plan and an invoice appears in both arms, and UNION only collapses rows that match
   * on every column, not on id alone.
   *
   * The three arms this screen unions together: payment logs reached through a user plan,
   * payment logs reached through an invoice, and invoices raised but never paid against.
   *
   * <p>Held as one constant because the list, its count and the summary must filter on exactly
   * the same rows — the list and count used to carry separate copies of this SQL, so a filter
   * fixed in one could silently drift from the other. {@code row_status} / {@code row_amount}
   * are carried so the summary can aggregate without a fourth copy; the outer list query simply
   * ignores them. UNION (not UNION ALL) still de-duplicates on id, which is a primary key in
   * every arm, so the extra columns cannot change which rows survive.</p>

   * Per-day PAID collection totals for an institute over a date window, optionally
   * scoped to a single sub-org. Sums payment_log.payment_amount for PAID payments,
   * grouped by the calendar day of payment_log.created_at in :timeZone (ascending).
   *
   * created_at is a naked UTC timestamp, so days were previously cut on UTC midnight and a payment
   * taken at 00:30 IST was charted under the previous day. :timeZone is an IANA zone the CALLER has
   * already validated (Postgres errors on an unknown one); pass 'UTC' for the original behaviour.
   * Only the day boundaries move — the window below still filters on UTC instants.
   *
   * Sub-org scoping is via enroll_invite.sub_org_id (a sub-org's SUBORG_LEARNER and
   * SUB_ORG invites both carry it), so it captures both the sub-org's learner fees
   * and its admin subscription. When noSubOrg=true the sub-org clause is skipped and
   * the whole institute is summed. Only the user_plan/enroll_invite payment path is
   * counted (not admin-invoice logs), which keeps the number cleanly sub-org-scopable.
   *
   * payment_log.currency is blank on a large share of rows (the invite it was copied from
   * carried no currency), so it is resolved against the plan being paid for and then the
   * invite — otherwise the dashboard gets no currency back and has to guess a symbol.

   * This endpoint failed 100% of the time in production -- verified against
