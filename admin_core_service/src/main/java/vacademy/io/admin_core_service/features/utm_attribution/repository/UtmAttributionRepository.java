    /**
     * Every touch for one person, oldest first.
     *
     * Matches on user_id OR the contact details, because three of the six
     * capture surfaces (audience form, live session, catalogue) never learn an
     * auth user id at submit time — they only have the email/mobile the visitor
     * typed. Keying the read on user_id alone made those rows unreachable
     * forever, which meant the learner side-view was permanently empty for
     * exactly the lead-generation surfaces the feature exists to measure.
     *
     * The contact fallback deliberately applies ONLY to rows that have no
     * user_id yet. A row already claimed by a user belongs to that user, and
     * matching it by shared contact details would hand one learner another's
     * history — families routinely register siblings on ONE parent mobile, so
     * that is the normal case here, not an edge case.
     *
     * NOTE ON LOWER(): the function is applied to the COLUMN only, never to the
     * bound parameter. Hibernate cannot infer a type for a null parameter that
     * sits inside a function call, binds it as untyped, and PostgreSQL then
     * resolves lower(untyped-null) to lower(bytea) — which does not exist, so
     * the whole statement fails. Callers pass an already-lowercased email.
