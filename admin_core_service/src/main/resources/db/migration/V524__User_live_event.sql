-- User live events -- the institute-wide live activity feed.
--
-- Distinct from admin_activity_log, which is admin-only by construction: that table is
-- written by AuditableAspect off the request thread's clientId header and is skipped
-- entirely when there is no request context. This one records what EVERY role is doing --
-- prospects filling forms, learners at checkout, counsellors calling, AI agents dialling,
-- webhook threads and scheduled jobs -- none of which the aspect can reach.
--
-- Rows are written by LiveActivityRecorder, which then fires pg_notify('live_activity')
-- so every replica's LISTEN connection can push the event to its SSE subscribers.

-- THE load-bearing constraint. Duplicates arrive from four independent directions:
-- multiple replicas running the same code, provider sibling events (Razorpay sends both
-- payment.captured AND order.paid for one payment), webhook retries and the deliberate
-- /webhook/reprocess replay, and @Scheduled jobs that lack @SchedulerLock (EwayPoolingService
-- and CallBillingReconciliationJob both poll on every replica and feed these producers).
--
-- Rather than harden each hook separately, the recorder does
--   INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (dedupe_key) DO NOTHING
-- and fires pg_notify ONLY when a row was actually inserted. The database is the arbiter;
-- the losing replica stays silent and subscribers see the event once.

-- Plain indexes, NOT CONCURRENTLY: this is a brand-new empty table so there is nothing to
