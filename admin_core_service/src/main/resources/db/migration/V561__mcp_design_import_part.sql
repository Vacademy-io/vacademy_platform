-- V561: MCP design_import — upload parts
-- ================================================================================
--
-- Background:
-- design_import is an opt-in MCP tool (ai_service, app/services/
-- assistant_tools_design_import.py). An institute admin's AI app reads a design
-- with ITS OWN Figma connection (get_metadata XML, get_design_context code) and
-- sends those results to Vacademy, which plans a website draft from them. The
-- server never fetches Figma and never holds a Figma token; this table only
-- parks what the AI app uploaded, for 24 hours, so a big design can arrive in
-- several calls and save_draft can re-plan it.
--
-- Why its own table and not ai_task: ai_task rows are served by unauthenticated
-- /task-status/* routes and several by-id pollers, and a client's artwork must
-- never be readable through them. Only assistant_tools_design_import reads or
-- writes this table, always filtered by the caller's pinned institute.
--
-- One row per uploaded PART, not per import: parallel chunk calls each INSERT
-- their own row, so no part is lost to a read-modify-write race. Every part of
-- an import carries the import's expires_at (copied from its first part), so a
-- bulk DELETE ... WHERE expires_at <= now() drops whole imports, never half of
-- one.
--
-- ai_service also ensures this schema at startup (app/models/design_import.py,
-- ensure_design_import_schema) so it runs standalone in local development. That
-- model and this migration must stay identical; this file is the source of
-- truth. Every statement is idempotent, so the two can safely both run.
--
-- If ai_service created the table first, it is owned by ai_service's database
-- role, and index or comment DDL from this role would fail with 42501. Those
-- statements are performance and documentation aids only, so an ownership
-- failure is skipped with a NOTICE instead of blocking the deploy (same
-- approach as V524).
