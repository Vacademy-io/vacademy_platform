"""Frame composition vocabulary — where things go on the canvas.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
──────────────────────
Craft review (2026-08-20) traced "the layouts all look the same" to an
asymmetry in the per-shot prompt, not to model capability:

  • Concrete, enforceable guidance about TYPE PROPERTIES — line-height per
    tier, letter-spacing per face, weight deltas, descender padding, scrim
    rules — runs to several hundred lines (`_build_text_hierarchy_block`).
  • Concrete guidance about FRAME COMPOSITION — where the subject sits, what
    the type aligns to, where the negative space goes — was two lines of
    adjectives: "hero asymmetry ... off-axis anchors ... avoid centered
    hero+sub on every shot".
  • Meanwhile the workhorse card's exemplar — the single strongest signal in
    the prompt — is `.full-screen-center` → `.layout-hero` → centered h1 +
    centered sub + centered svg.

The model did what the prompt actually asked: it copied the example and
ignored the adjectives. Every shot came out centre-stacked. This module
replaces the adjectives with a named, concrete, per-shot-assigned vocabulary,
mirroring how `background_treatment` already works — planner declares it,
pipeline defaults it, the per-shot prompt enforces it with real code.

Compositions are ASSIGNED, not hoped for. `assign_compositions()` walks the
shot list and enforces variety structurally (no repeat inside a window, hard
cap on centre-stacked shots) because "aim for a distinct composition every
shot" as prose has been in the preamble for months and did not produce one.

The CSS lives here as a plain module string rather than inline in the
pipeline's preamble f-string. That is deliberate: CSS written directly into
that f-string needs every brace doubled, and getting it wrong fails at
generation time with `NameError: name 'position' is not defined` (cost a
debug cycle on 2026-08-20). Interpolated as a value, braces are inert.

# The vocabulary
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each entry carries:
#   css_class — the grid class in COMPOSITION_CSS. Stored, not derived from
#              the name: center_hero maps to .comp-center, full_bleed_overlay
#              to .comp-full-bleed, and deriving it silently mismatched both.
#   blurb    — one line for the ShotPlanner's menu (it picks by name)
#   contract — concrete skeleton injected into that shot's own prompt. This is
#              the part that actually changes output: it competes with the
#              card exemplar on the card exemplar's own terms (real code).
#   air      — where the negative space is meant to end up. Named so the model
#              treats emptiness as a designed element instead of filling it.
#   suits    — shot types this reads well on (advisory; used for defaults)

/* --- FRAME COMPOSITION GRID ---------------------------------------
   Text columns are align-items:stretch, never flex-start. With flex-start a
   heading is shrink-to-fit: its box hugs the text, so a phrase that WOULD fit
   the column wraps anyway — and because the box tracks the text, shrinking the
   font shrinks the box too and the overflow never clears. That is what put
   "TRIGEMIN / AL" on two lines in a 562px column that had room for it.
   Named frames. Every composition is a 12x8 grid so type and subjects
   land on the same lines from shot to shot. Placement is the design;
   .comp-center is ONE option, not the default. */
/* The container rule is repeated on every composition class, not just on
   .comp. A real run authored <div class="comp-spine"> without the .comp
   wrapper: the placement rules still matched, but there was no grid to place
   into, so the flex children collapsed to min-content and the labels rendered
   one letter per line down the left edge. Requiring two cooperating class
   names is a contract the model will drop sooner or later, so either form has
   to stand on its own. */

# Exemplars — the part of the prompt the model actually imitates
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every shot card ships a centre-stacked example, and marketing mode already
# proved the fix: MARKETING_EXAMPLES swaps the exemplar per card because "the
# example code is the strongest signal in the prompt". Educational/aspirational
# runs never got that treatment — they got prose telling them to avoid the
# frame the example demonstrates.
#
# One exemplar is injected per shot (the assigned composition's), REPLACING the
# card's, so the prompt does not grow. Each one is written to be worth copying:
# real type hierarchy with explicit leading and weight, motion with named eases
# on narration beats, a back-half beat, and staging where the frame invites it.
# Deliberately NOT centred, and deliberately not decorative — the reveals are
# tied to what is being said.
