"""
Sound Planner — derives per-shot sound cues from the finished Director plan,
skill composer output, and narration emphasis signals. No LLM calls.

Design:
  1. Build a SOUND PALETTE once per video — 3-4 variations per role for
     variety. Topic-biased selection from script keywords (money → coins).
  2. Place cues at structural moments (transitions, reveals, emphasis)
     with subtle timing offsets for a natural feel.
  3. Use low volumes so sounds are background texture, not foreground.
  4. Respect global budgets so even a 30-shot video stays controlled.

The Director does NOT see sound information. Everything is derived from
signals the Director already produced for visual reasons.

# DEMOLISHED 2026-05: SHOT_TYPE_CUE + _FAMILY tables removed.
#
# Old behavior: every shot got an automatic signature cue (e.g. VIDEO_HERO
# → transition_whoosh at t=0), and every cross-family shot boundary got
# a pre-roll whoosh. Net effect: 10+ whooshes in a 53s video, with sound
# placed because the timeline said "cut here", not because anything on
# screen actually made a sound.
#
# New behavior: sound effects fire ONLY when the visual layer emits an
# event that a real-world version would produce sound for (button click,
# typewriter, counter tick, drawn underline, etc.). Events come from
# two sources:
#   1. Director's per-shot `sync_points[*].action` text (B1, mapped to
#      role via _ACTION_TO_ROLE below).
#   2. GSAP timeline scanner that parses each shot's generated HTML/JS
#      and emits cues on actual on-screen animations (Stage 2 — pipeline
#      attaches these as `entry["_sfx_events"]` before plan_sounds runs).
#
# If neither source emits an event for a shot, that shot is silent.
# That's the design — silence is the correct sound for "nothing audible
# happened on screen." We do NOT add filler cues to mark transitions.

#   - "max_in_window" / "_DENSITY_WINDOW_S": no more than N cues in any rolling
#     window of W seconds. Dense modes allow more.
#   - "min_avg_gap_s": after the window pass, drop the lowest-priority cues
#     until total_cues * min_avg_gap_s <= video_duration_s.
#
# Transition cues (role == "transition_whoosh"/"transition_riser") are protected
# from drops — they're tied to cuts. Other roles are dropped first.

# Retuned 2026-05 (second pass) after the auto-transition rules were
# demolished. Density was originally a defense against transition-spam
# in the old "whoosh on every cut" regime; with the new event-driven
# planner (GSAP scanner emits only audibility-worthy events, capped to
# ~6 per shot), density's main job is now ONLY to prevent runaway
# stacks in pathological cases (e.g. typewriter + 4 staggered reveals
# in a 1s window).

# scanner-emitted cues from stage-2 drops; only true cluster-busts
