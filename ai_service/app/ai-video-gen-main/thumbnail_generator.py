"""
Thumbnail generator — single Recraft call with text baked into the image.

Called from automation_pipeline immediately after the Director plan is finalized.
Generates ONE thumbnail (not 4) using Recraft, which renders the headline text
directly into the image — no client-side overlay needed.

Soft-fails everywhere: thumbnails are a nice-to-have, never gate the render.
If the call fails, the caller persists `{}` and the FE shows a placeholder.

History: an earlier version produced 4 Seedream options with a client-side
text overlay. Seedream hallucinated text/hex codes into the image even with
explicit "no text" guards, and the FE overlay couldn't fully compensate for
poor base images. The single-Recraft path lets one model own both the
photograph and the typography.
