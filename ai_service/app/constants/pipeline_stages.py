"""Pipeline stage taxonomy — the canonical enum every LLM call site in the AI
video pipeline maps to. Used by `AIModelsService.get_stage_model_map(...)` to
resolve a stage_id → model_id mapping from the `ai_model_stage_assignments`
table, and by `cost_event_tracker` to bucket cost events per stage.

The taxonomy is intentionally narrower than the set of physical call sites —
the five HTML regen prompts (html_repair / brand_asset / bbox / vision_corrective
/ animation_validator) collapse into one `regen_html` bucket because they share
intent and budget, and admins/users shouldn't have to manage five rows for the
same logical decision.

`USER_OVERRIDABLE` is the subset whose model can be replaced by a user-supplied
override on the video-generation request. Anything outside this set ignores the
override and uses the admin-configured default (matrix row in DB) — this keeps
small utility prompts from blowing up cost when a user picks a premium model
for the critical stages.
