"""
AiTaskService — lifecycle + background execution for AI async tasks.

Mirrors the media_service flow: a request creates a PROGRESS row and returns a
taskId immediately; an asyncio worker runs the actual work and flips the row to
COMPLETED (with result_json) or FAILED (with status_message). The DB row is the
source of truth, so progress survives restarts; the in-flight coroutine does
not (same reliability bar as the Java `aiTaskExecutor`).

Concurrency is bounded by a module-level semaphore sized to mirror the Java
pool, so a burst can't exhaust the shared pgbouncer pool or OOM the pod.
