"""
The ``website`` tool — read-only access to the institute's websites (catalogue
sites built in Manage Pages) for the Assistant and the MCP server.

ONE tool with an ``action`` argument rather than one tool per question, so the
institute's settings tab has a single "Website: view" toggle to manage per role
and the model reads one schema. Actions:

    list            every site: status, live URL, draft pending, last published
    get_page        one page's sections in order, with where each block's data comes from
    context         what the AI may link to: courses, product pages, lead campaigns, theme
                    (detail=true adds course tags / language / format / invites, folder libraries, path steps)
    data_inventory  the data a design maps onto: courses in detail, tag vocabulary, folder libraries, paths
    data_audit      the data behind the site's widgets, checked: stream / language / format tags, empty
                    folders, version groups, paths, authored prices, payment gateways
    analytics       traffic + lead counts for the last N days
    lead_summary    every lead-capture surface on the site and whether it is wired
    audit           the dashboard's pre-publish checks
    brief_checklist the interview an AI should run before generating a site
    schema          the component contract (+ header/footer chrome, site-settings contract, pattern index)
    patterns        design patterns: what a look is called, its minimal and full JSON, what it needs
    list_media      images the caller has uploaded (for logos / photos)
    strings         texts with no translation yet in one of the site's languages

Identity is pinned by ``execute_tool``; every ``tag_name`` is resolved against
the pinned institute's own catalogues, never trusted from the model.

Data loading (``load_site``, ``resolve_tag`` …) lives in ``website_data`` so the
write tool and the lead-forms tool share it without importing this module.
