"""Background poller that drains the `call_intelligence` work queue.

A single asyncio task (started from the app lifespan) repeatedly:
  1. re-arms rows a crashed worker left mid-flight (and bounded FAILED retries),
  2. atomically CLAIMS a batch of PENDING rows (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so
     multiple ai_service replicas never grab the same row),
  3. enriches each with its recording storage key from telephony_call_log,
  4. processes them concurrently via call_intelligence_service.process_one.

Mirrors the existing reels reaper pattern (asyncio loop, idempotent start()).
