"""
Cancellation registry — a tiny module shared by the async router and the
sync pipeline thread.

A single ``threading.Event`` per ``video_id``. The router sets it from
``POST /cancel/{video_id}``; the pipeline checks ``is_set()`` at safe
points (stage boundaries, before each parallel HTML shot submission) and
raises ``PipelineCancelled`` to unwind.

We use ``threading.Event`` rather than ``asyncio.Event`` because the
pipeline runs inside a thread executor (``loop.run_in_executor(...)``) and
must not import asyncio internals to check the flag.
