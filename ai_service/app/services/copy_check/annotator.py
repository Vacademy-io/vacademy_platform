"""Burn the AI's corrections onto the answer sheet and upload it as a file.

Until this existed, a graded copy left no artifact: marks and feedback landed
in Postgres and the annotations stayed as JSON coordinates, drawn live in the
browser by the admin dashboard's PdfAnnotationOverlay. Every other admin screen
resolves the checked copy through student_attempt.evaluated_file_id, so those
screens showed "No evaluated copy found" on an evaluation that had in fact
completed.

This module composites the annotations onto the student's PDF and uploads the
result to media-service, returning a fileId the Java side can store on the
attempt.

Coordinates: layout_map boxes are [x, y, w, h] in PIXELS at the map's own dpi
(see render_worker/pdf_ocr/layout_ocr.py). PDF user space is points. Rather
than assuming 72/dpi, scale by the ratio of the real page rect to the layout
page's recorded width/height — that stays correct if a page was rasterized at
a different dpi than the map claims, or if pages differ in size.
