"""Run enforce.py over this pipeline's verdicts, in place.

enforce() takes the grader's outputs as a flat list and returns a flat list of
annotations keyed by `q`; this pipeline carries one verdict dict per question
and renders from each verdict's own `annotations`. The bridge converts on the
way in and writes the enforced annotations back on the way out, so the
orchestrator, the renderer and every test keep the shape they already use.

    verdicts, total, report, unmarked = apply_enforcement(verdicts, layout_map)

Placement names: enforce emits the marking guide's names (right_margin,
below_line, ...); the validator's canonical field is `position` in the older
vocabulary. Both are written so either reader works.
