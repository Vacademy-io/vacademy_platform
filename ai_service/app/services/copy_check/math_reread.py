"""Second reading of the maths lines on an answer sheet, by the vision model.

Replaces the Mathpix fallback (mathpix_fallback.py) for copy-check.

Why
---
render_worker flags low-confidence OCR lines `needs_math_fallback`, and the old
step sent up to four of them to Mathpix and OVERWROTE the row text with the
answer. Measured on two real Maths copies (2026-10-01, 25 flagged lines, every
disputed crop checked by eye), out of 23 lines that could be judged:

  full-page vision read (already done)   19 right
  GLM-5.3-flash on the crop              14 right
  Mathpix on the crop                    12 right

Mathpix misread digits (-1 as -4, 2ca as 20a) and garbled prose ("Cliven that
the twa chards"). Worse, some OCR row boxes are narrower than the line they
carry (42 px for "x² + 1/x² = 27"), so the crop held one letter and Mathpix's
"\\chi" replaced a correct reading. Most flagged lines on non-maths copies were
plain prose ("(ii) Troposphere", "to vote"). Mathpix is billed per image on
every copy; the same close-up through the vision model we already run costs a
small fraction of that.

The crop readers were still right on a few lines where the full-page read was
wrong (164/3 read as "161/3 + 3", "(a-d)(a+d)" as "(a+d)(a+d)"), because a
close-up resolves small fractions and signs better than a whole page does.

So this step
------------
  * re-reads every row whose text looks like maths, flagged by the OCR or not.
    The flag alone missed most of them: on a page of fraction working only 2
    of 23 rows were flagged, the full-page read had turned every 7 into a 1
    ("1/5 ... = 1/30" for "7/5 ... = 7/30"), and the one flagged row's
    close-up read it right ("7/5 x 1/6");
  * takes a stacked fraction's other half into the same crop - its numerator
    or denominator is often a row of its own ("= 7" over "30");
  * widens each crop to the full width of the page's writing, and pads it
    vertically so a fraction's numerator and denominator are both inside —
    a crop narrower than the line was the main way the old step failed;
  * reads it with the same vision model as the page read;
  * NEVER overwrites the row. The close-up goes into `second_reading` and the
    grading prompt shows both, so the grader decides with the page in view
    instead of being handed one reader's guess as fact.
