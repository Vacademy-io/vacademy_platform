"""grade_copy() — the end-to-end copy-check flow that ai_service runs as a
FastAPI BackgroundTask. Reads from CopyCheckGradeRequest, drives render_worker
OCR, resolves rubrics per question, gives low-confidence maths lines a close-up
second reading, grades each, and POSTs per-question + final callbacks to Java.

Cancellation is checked at three checkpoints — before OCR, before grading,
and between questions — matching the Java cancellation model.
