"""LLM JSON validation + marks cap + annotation target resolution.

Three jobs:
  1. Coerce loose LLM output into the QuestionVerdict shape (with safe defaults).
  2. Cap marks_awarded to question.max_marks and proportionally scale the
     criteria_breakdown so the sum still equals marks_awarded.
  3. Resolve every annotation to a real row: by `target` line_id/region_id
     when that exists, else by matching the verbatim `anchor_text` the model
     quoted from the student's writing. Only an annotation that matches
     nothing at all is dropped — a mark placed a row off is a teacher being
     untidy, a mark silently discarded is a page that comes back unmarked.
