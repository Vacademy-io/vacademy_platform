"""Vision-model re-reading of the answer sheet, replacing PaddleOCR's text.

Why this exists
---------------
`render_worker/pdf_ocr/layout_ocr.py` runs PaddleOCR's **printed-text**
recogniser on handwriting (its own docstring says so — there is no English
handwriting checkpoint). On a real 13-page law copy it produced 686 "lines"
totalling 3,382 characters — about 260 per page against a realistic 800-2,000 —
with a maximum of 30 characters per line and 94 lines that were a single
character. Words came back as `'yromrp'` and `'Maccidinta!'`.

Grading off that transcript is not lenient, it is *random*: the model
reconstructs a plausible textbook answer from keyword fragments and awards
marks at high confidence for prose the student never wrote, or sees nothing
and awards 0 to a full answer. No prompt change can fix a grader that cannot
read the page.

So we re-read each page with a vision model that actually can. Measured on
page 3 of that same copy (2026-09-09, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`): 935 characters of
correct, fluent legal prose for $0.00029 — versus PaddleOCR's ~260 characters
of noise for the whole page.

What we keep from PaddleOCR
---------------------------
The **geometry**. PaddleOCR's boxes are positionally accurate even when its
text is wrong, and annotations need boxes to draw on. So this module:

  1. merges PaddleOCR's word-level boxes into true visual rows (pure geometry,
     no model involved) — which also fixes annotation anchoring, since a
     `strike` was previously drawn across one mis-read word rather than the
     line it belonged to; and
  2. asks the vision model to rewrite the text of each row, given the page
     image and the row list.

The row ids stay in the layout map, so `validator._layout_target_index` and
`annotator._target_index` keep working unchanged.

Cost
----
One call per page, not per question — the transcript is then reused by every
question's grading call. A 13-page copy costs roughly $0.004 (~0.6 credits).

Read the page image yourself and return the text the student ACTUALLY wrote.

Rules:
- Transcribe VERBATIM. Keep the student's spelling, grammar and factual
  mistakes exactly as written. Do not correct, complete or improve anything.
  Do not fill in what you think a good answer would say — you are reading a
  page, not writing one.
- Return one entry per row id above, in the same order, so each line keeps its
  position on the page. Row ids are fixed; do not invent, merge, drop or
  renumber them.
- Use each row's stated position down the page to decide WHICH line of the
  image it is. The row list may contain more rows than there are lines of
  writing (ruled lines and margins get detected too) — in that case leave the
  extra rows blank rather than shifting your text onto them. Anchoring text to
  the wrong row puts a teacher's tick on the wrong line.
- If a row is genuinely unreadable, set its text to "[illegible]".
- If a row holds no student writing (a blank, a ruled line, a page number),
  set its text to "".
- Some rows are the PRINTED question paper rather than the student's answer.
  Transcribe those too, and set "printed": true for them, so the grader does
  not mistake the question for the answer.
- `page_text` is the whole page as continuous, readable prose (the same
  content, joined into paragraphs). This is what the grader reads, so it
  matters most.
