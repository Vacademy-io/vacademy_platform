Figma links: how to spot one, and what to tell the admin when one is given to
a part of the product that cannot open it.

Product decision 1 (2026-10-10): NO server-side Figma — no stored Figma tokens
and no REST fetch. A figma.com file link opened without the owner's session
renders Figma's login wall, so the in-product wizard used to "capture the
reference site" as a picture of a sign-in form and design from that. Every
surface that receives a Figma link (the wizard's reference / rebuild URL, the
intake chat, design_import(source='figma_url'), the playbook) now refuses it
the same way and points at the two routes that work.

A published Figma Sites page (``*.figma.site``) is a normal public website and
is NOT matched here.
