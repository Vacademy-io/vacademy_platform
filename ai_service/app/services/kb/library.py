"""The knowledge base library — a catalogue of published corpora.

Knowledge bases owned by one internal publisher institute can be described,
published, and unlocked by client institutes for a one-time credit charge.

Two ideas are kept deliberately apart:

  * a LISTING is merchandising — the title, cover and description a stranger
    reads while deciding whether to spend credits. It lives in its own table so
    unpublishing never touches the corpus.
  * an ENTITLEMENT is the right to generate from that corpus. It is checked by
    KbRepository.is_usable, never inferred from being able to read the listing.
