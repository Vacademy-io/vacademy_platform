"""The topic tree — what a knowledge base is ABOUT, across all its sources.

This is deliberately a different view from the V435 summary tree:

    summary tree   per source, page-ordered   book → chapter → section
    topic tree     per knowledge base         topic → subtopic

The summary tree answers "where does this come from" and drives coverage
planning inside one book. The topic tree answers "what can I set a test on",
which is the question a teacher is actually asking, and it is the one that has
to span sources: a knowledge base of ten past papers should offer
"Electrochemistry" ONCE, not ten times, and should never offer "pages 1-4" or
"Answer Keys" as if those were subjects.

Built from the section summaries and keywords the ingest already produced, so it
costs one extra LLM call per rebuild rather than a re-read of the corpus.

  "topics": [
    {{
      "title": "a real topic a teacher would set a test on, e.g. 'Integral Calculus'",
      "summary": "one line on what this topic covers in THIS material",
      "keywords": ["specific concepts inside it"],
      "subtopics": [
        {{
          "title": "a narrower testable area, e.g. 'Definite integrals and properties'",
          "summary": "one line NAMING the specific tests, tables, named methods and concepts this subtopic covers in the material — e.g. 'Snellen chart, Ishihara plates, accommodation reflex, fundoscopy'. Course slides are generated from these names; a vague summary loses content.",

}}

RULES THAT MATTER:
- Topics must be SUBJECTS, never page ranges, file names, shift numbers or dates.
  "Integral Calculus" — yes. "Questions p. 1-4", "23 Jan Shift 1", "Answer Keys" — never.
- MERGE across sources. If four different papers all cover electrochemistry, that is ONE topic,
  not four. This is the single most important rule: the whole point is a teacher sees each subject
  once for the entire knowledge base.
- Every topic needs 2-{MAX_SUBTOPICS_PER_TOPIC} subtopics. A topic with no subtopics is too vague
  to set questions from.
- Skip anything that is not teachable content: answer keys, indexes, instructions, blank or
  unreadable pages.
- At most {MAX_TOPICS} topics. If the material is broad, group at the level a syllabus would —
  prefer "Thermodynamics" over fifteen separate laws.
- Order topics the way a syllabus would, not the way the files happened to be uploaded.
- SINGLE COHERENT TEXT (one book/chapter rather than many mixed papers): keep the material's OWN
  section headings as subtopic titles, in the material's own order — teachers review these titles
  against their book, and re-themed names read as missing content. Re-theme titles only when
  merging genuinely overlapping sources.
- GRANULARITY for a single text: aim for roughly ONE subtopic per section heading of the material
  (each becomes one course page) — do NOT compress a chapter's sections into 2 broad subtopics;
  a reviewer comparing against the book reads merged subtopics as dropped content. Never merge
  two different nerves/organs/procedures into one subtopic when the material treats them
  separately.
