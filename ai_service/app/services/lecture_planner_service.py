"""
LecturePlannerService — the LLM half of the migrated lecture planner.

Replaces media_service DeepSeekLectureService, with the model id resolved from
the DB-backed registry (/models/v2) instead of the hardcoded
`google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025` string that caused the prod 404.

The prompt template and field defaults are copied verbatim from
media_service ConstantAiTemplate#getLecturePlannerTemplate and
DeepSeekLectureService so the generated JSON shape matches LecturePlanDto.

Model resolution, the prompt→JSON LLM call, and usage/credit billing are all
delegated to the shared foundation modules (model_selection, llm_json,
ai_billing) used by every migrated feature.
