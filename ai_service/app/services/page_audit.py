"""Design audit for AI-composed catalogue pages.

The composer's output was only ever checked for SAFETY (allowlisted component
types, scrubbed URLs, sanitized HTML) — never for whether the page is any good.
Every quality defect this year was caught by a human opening the published page:
sections that rendered as blank bands, a ctaBanner with no button, a hero with
an empty image slot, a productPageOffer bound to no product page. None of those
need a model to spot; they are decidable from the JSON.

This module is that decision. It is deliberately DETERMINISTIC — no LLM, no
scoring, no taste. Every rule here describes a defect that would be visible to a
visitor, so a finding can be handed straight to a repair pass without a human
adjudicating it first. Judgement calls (is the copy good? does this match the
reference?) are out of scope on purpose: a rule that is sometimes wrong would
teach the repair pass to damage correct pages.

Severity:
  fix  — a visitor sees something broken or empty; worth spending a repair call.
  warn — worth telling the admin, not worth an automatic edit.
