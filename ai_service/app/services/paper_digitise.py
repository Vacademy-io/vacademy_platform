"""Digitise a question-paper PDF into gradable questions.

The offline-exam flow (Shiksha Nation's daily use) attaches the paper as a PDF
in the test description; learners download it, solve on paper and upload a scan.
The assessment behind it has one placeholder question ("Upload your answer
sheet.") carrying every mark, so the AI checker — which grades question by
question — has nothing to grade against.

This module turns that attached PDF into the assessment's real questions:

    fetch(pdf_url) → validate → MathPix HTML → LLM extraction (verbatim,
    with marks) → assessment-builder DTOs with a marking rubric each

Rules that matter here and not in the generic PDF→questions tool:
  * Every printed question is kept, in order, with ITS marks — the checker's
    maximum per question comes from here.
  * Nothing is invented as fact: an answer the paper does not print is marked
    `answer_source: "model"` so the teacher is told to verify it.
  * The charge is per page + a flat base, and only when questions come back.

Rules:
1. Verbatim. Copy the wording, numbers, units and sub-parts as printed. Do not paraphrase, merge, split or "improve" questions. Instructions, headers, section titles and the marking-scheme lines are NOT questions.
2. Sub-parts. "3 (a)…(b)…" printed with ONE mark figure is ONE question containing both parts. Sub-parts printed with their OWN marks are separate questions numbered "3(a)", "3(b)".
3. "OR" choices. Keep both alternatives inside ONE question, prefixed "Either … OR …", and add a note.
4. Marks. Use the figure printed next to the question ("[5]", "(2 marks)", "2M"). If none, use the section's "each carries N marks" and set marks_source "section". A block printed as ONE numbered question but made of several scored items (match-the-following pairs, a set of fill-in-the-blanks, "4 × 1") carries the SUM of its items' marks. If nothing is printed anywhere, marks = null and marks_source "none" — never guess a number.
5. Answers. If the paper prints an answer key, use it and set answer_source "paper". Otherwise, for MCQS/MCQM/TRUE_FALSE/ONE_WORD/NUMERIC give your best answer with answer_source "model" (the teacher will verify). For LONG_ANSWER leave ans empty unless printed, but ALWAYS fill marking_points with what a full-mark answer must contain.
6. Types. Single correct option → MCQS; "choose all that apply" → MCQM; true/false → TRUE_FALSE; a numeric result → NUMERIC; a word/phrase → ONE_WORD; everything else (explain, describe, prove, draw, solve with steps) → LONG_ANSWER. For TRUE_FALSE always give options [{{"preview_id":"1","content":"True"}},{{"preview_id":"2","content":"False"}}] and correct_options ["1"] or ["2"]. If an answer cannot be determined (a table or figure is missing), leave it empty and set answer_source "none" — never write "model" for an empty answer.
7. Keep every <img …> tag and every <!--DS_TAG:…--> comment exactly where it appears in the source.
8. Valid JSON only. No markdown fences, no commentary outside the JSON.
