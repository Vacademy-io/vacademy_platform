"""Digitise an EXISTING question paper — every question, verbatim, with its key.

This is the `mode=extract` path of /math-parser/pdf-to-questions. The older
path (question_gen_service.questions_from_html) is a GENERATOR: one model
call over the whole document, "include the first 20 questions", free to
paraphrase. That is right for "make me 10 MCQs from this chapter" and wrong
for "put my 60-question mock test into Vacademy", which is what Vsmart
Extract promises. This module does what a careful person does with a paper:

  1. cut the paper into parts at question boundaries so no call is asked to
     return more than it can without truncating;
  2. set the answer key / solutions section aside — it must not be read as
     questions, and it must be applied to them afterwards;
  3. read each part with a prompt that forbids inventing, rephrasing,
     solving or skipping, and keeps shared passages / data tables with every
     question that depends on them;
  4. merge, de-duplicate on the paper's own numbering, and map the printed
     key onto the options.

The result is the same RAW question JSON the rest of the pipeline consumes
(question_format.convert_to_question_paper_response on read), plus
`passage`, `section`, `marks`, `negative_marks`, `option_label` per question
and an `extraction` summary at the root.
