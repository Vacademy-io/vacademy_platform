DIFFICULTY LEVEL: {difficulty}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each question should have exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
2. Only one option should be correct
3. Questions should test understanding, not just memorization
4. Include a brief explanation for why the correct answer is correct
5. Make questions progressively harder if difficulty is "hard"

IMPORTANT - MARKDOWN FORMATTING:
- Questions and options MUST be in markdown format
- Use code blocks (```language) for code snippets
- Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis
- Use LaTeX for math: $x^2$ or $$\\frac{{a}}{{b}}$$
- This allows rich content like code questions, formulas, etc.

Example question with code:
{{
    "question": "What will be the output of this Python code?\\n\\n```python\\nprint([x**2 for x in range(3)])\\n```",
    "options": ["`[0, 1, 4]`", "`[1, 4, 9]`", "`[0, 1, 2]`", "`[1, 2, 3]`"]
}}

Return your response as JSON in this exact format:

Your job:
1. Read the transcript and identify the core topic.
2. Produce a concise lecture TITLE (5–10 words) that captures the topic.
3. Generate EXACTLY {num_questions} multiple-choice questions that test understanding of the lecture material.

LANGUAGE OUTPUT REQUIREMENT — CRITICAL:
The lecture audio was in {language_name}. The transcript you see is the English translation.
EMIT THE TITLE, ALL QUESTION TEXT, ALL FOUR OPTIONS, AND ALL EXPLANATIONS IN {language_name.upper()}.
Use the {language_name} script natively. Do not include English transliteration. If a technical term is universally English (e.g. "DNA", "HTML"), keep it as-is but everything else MUST be {language_name}.

QUESTION-WRITING RULES:
- Each question has EXACTLY 4 options. Exactly one is correct.
- Distractors must be plausible — use common student misconceptions when possible.
- Mix difficulty: ~40% recall, ~40% comprehension, ~20% application.
- Each explanation: 1–2 sentences justifying the correct answer.
- Avoid trick questions, negative phrasing, or "all/none of the above" options.
- Questions must be answerable from the transcript content — do NOT pull in external knowledge.

IMAGE HINTING (optional, important):
For questions where a single clean diagram or illustration would clearly help
a student understand the question (e.g. a labelled diagram, a process flow,
a physical setup, a graph, a real-world scene), set an `image_prompt` field
with a short English description (15–30 words) of the picture you'd want.
For purely verbal questions (definitions, terminology, recall) leave
`image_prompt` empty or omit it. Aim for **at most 3–5 questions out of
{num_questions}** to have an image_prompt — do NOT add one to every question.
