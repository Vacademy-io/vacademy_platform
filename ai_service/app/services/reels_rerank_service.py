"""
LLM selection pass for /scan — the semantic judge with real authority.

The 4-axis heuristic in `reels_engagement_service` is a cheap PREFILTER: it
enumerates and scores every window of the source and hands the diversified
top-K (≤60) here. This module runs ONE LLM call that hard-SELECTS and orders
the final top-N the user sees. The heuristic composite is advisory input to
the LLM, not the ranking authority — token-level proxies (opener word lists,
TF-IDF spread) cannot judge "would I actually post this?"; a model reading
the full window transcript can.

Design:
  * Single call per cold /scan. Each window ships its FULL transcript
    (middle-elided only past _TRANSCRIPT_CHAR_CAP chars), start/end times,
    predicted output duration, and the heuristic axis scores as advisory
    signals. The request's real target duration + topic keywords are in the
    prompt — selection criteria match what the user actually asked for.
  * The model returns an ordered `selection` array (best first) of exactly
    the ids it wants surfaced, with a one-line reason each. `apply_selection`
    reorders the heuristic candidates to match, fills any shortfall from the
    heuristic order, and re-assigns composites monotonically (the FE sorts by
    composite; rank is authoritative, so composite must agree with rank).
  * On any failure (no API key, transport error, malformed response, zero
    valid ids) the caller falls back to the pure-heuristic order — selection
    never blocks /scan.

The module keeps its historical filename; the ±10% "rerank nudge" it used to
implement is gone.

The input is a list of candidate windows cut from ONE long source video.
Each window has: an id, start/end seconds, its predicted duration after
silence/filler trimming, its transcript, and advisory heuristic scores
(0-100; computed from audio/token statistics — useful hints, NOT ground
truth; overrule them whenever the transcript says otherwise).

Select the N best windows and order them best-first. Judge each window as a
STANDALONE vertical clip (TikTok / Reels / Shorts):
  * Hook: the first sentence must earn the next 3 seconds — concrete claim,
    number, story opening, or counterintuitive framing.
  * Self-contained: no dangling references to earlier context, no setup
    without payoff. The clip must resolve the idea it opens.
  * One clear idea per clip; dense, not rambling.
  * Prefer windows whose predicted duration is close to the target.
  * If topic keywords are given, prefer windows that actually cover them.
Down-rank: mid-sentence starts, trailing thoughts, meta-talk about the video
itself, housekeeping ("like and subscribe"), greetings.

Return STRICT JSON, no prose:
{
  "selection": [
    {"id": "<input id>", "reason": "<5-12 words, a real critique>"},
    ...
  ]
}

Rules: exactly N entries (fewer only if fewer inputs qualify at all), best
clip FIRST, every id must come from the input, no id twice."""
