"""Resolve the real text of a PDF slide for the learner chatbot.

Why this exists
---------------
The learner app builds `context_meta` client-side and sends
`document_slide.published_data` as the slide's `content`
(`useChatbot.ts` buildContextMeta). For `type='CODE'` and `type='DOC'` that
field genuinely holds text, but for `type='PDF'` it holds a **media fileId** —
and PDF is the platform's dominant slide type (9,711 of 16,732 document_slide
rows; 9,173 of them store a bare UUID there).

So the tutor was being handed a string like
"487fc9b7-e886-4a6a-a517-123162a99fa7" as the lesson content. Measured in
production: of 705 DOCUMENT slide sessions only 27 carried usable text, and of
500 VIDEO sessions, none did. The model then answered from the slide *title*
plus general knowledge, and sometimes invented what was on the slide
("this slide is essentially the title page for the chapter…"). A 36-char UUID
also passes the `len > 20` topic check in
`IntentClassifierService.get_practice_topic`, so it could be used as a quiz topic.

Design constraints
------------------
1. **Never download or parse inside a held DB session.** `resolve_context()`
   runs inside one of the agent's short-lived DB blocks, and a multi-second
   fetch+parse there is exactly the pattern that exhausted the SQLAlchemy pool
   in the 2026-08-19 incident. So the request path does one cheap indexed cache
   read and nothing else; extraction happens on a bounded background task with
   its own session.
2. **No paid OCR.** `kb.parsing.parse_pdf` routes scanned pages to MathPix,
   which bills per page. Extracting on every slide view would be an unbounded
   cost, so this calls the free PyMuPDF pass (`_extract_sync`) directly and
   simply discards `ocr_payloads`. A scanned/image-only PDF therefore yields no
   text — and the tutor is told it cannot read the slide, which is the honest
   outcome and costs nothing.
3. **Reuse the existing cache.** `file_conversion` is already a
   fileId -> extracted-text cache with an idempotent boot-time DDL, so a slide
   whose PDF was previously converted by a MathPix path is reused for free.

    SECURITY GATE — do not remove. `context_meta` is built client-side and the
    /chat-agent routes carry no auth, so `content` is attacker-controllable and
    `institute_id` is client-supplied. Without this check, resolving a fileId to
    text turns the tutor into an arbitrary cross-tenant file reader: anyone could
    open a session, set content to a fileId belonging to another institute, ask
    "summarise this slide", and be read the contents of a file they have no claim
    to. Before slide-text resolution existed the UUID was passed through as inert
    junk, so this capability is new and must be scoped.

    Measured against production traffic: this allows 631 of 636 real slide
    sessions (99.2%). The handful it rejects are learners viewing a slide owned by
