"""
The design playbook an AI follows to rebuild a design (a Figma file, screenshots
or a live site) as a Vacademy website — served by website(action='playbook'),
the MCP prompt ``figma_to_site`` and the resource ``vacademy://playbook/{source}``.

It is the Brahm Varchas build (2026-10, the first Figma → site rebuild) written
down as steps with budgets and stop conditions, using ONLY actions that exist on
this server today. Nothing here reads institute data: the playbook is the same
for every caller, and its Figma → pattern table is generated from the
design-pattern registry's ``figmaCues`` (catalogue_schema_catalog.json, exported
from frontend-learner-dashboard-app/src/routes/$tagName/-ai/design-patterns.ts),
so a new pattern shows up here without editing this file.

Path A only: the caller reads the design with its OWN Figma MCP / vision. This
server never fetches Figma and stores no Figma credentials.
