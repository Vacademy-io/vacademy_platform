    """Escape stray backslashes so LaTeX-bearing JSON becomes parseable.

    LaTeX is made almost entirely of invalid JSON escapes — \\sqrt, \\int, \\pi,
    \\alpha, \\cdot — so a model writing "Evaluate $\\int_0^1 \\sqrt{x}dx$"
    emits JSON that json.loads rejects with "Invalid \\escape", and the whole
    generation is discarded. Prose parses fine; maths, physics and chemistry fail
    essentially always.

    A regex cannot do this correctly, for two reasons found by testing:

      * `\\f` IS a valid JSON escape (form feed), so skipping it turns `\\frac`
        into FORMFEED + "rac" — silently mangled rather than rejected, which is
        worse than the original bug. Same for `\\theta`, `\\beta`, `\\to`.
      * A correctly escaped `\\\\` must be consumed as ONE unit; matching
        backslashes individually adds a third one and corrupts valid input.

    So this walks the text, tracks whether it is inside a JSON string, and
    consumes escape sequences as units. For the ambiguous single letters
    (b/f/n/r/t) it disambiguates on the NEXT character: `\\n"` ends an escape and
    is a newline, while `\\nu` continues into letters and is a LaTeX command.

    Only ever called after normal parsing has already failed, so well-formed
    output is never rewritten.
