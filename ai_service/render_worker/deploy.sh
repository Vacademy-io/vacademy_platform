# Deploy render worker to the k3s cluster — thin wrapper around
# the GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/docker-publish-render-worker.yml
#
# The actual build + push + rollout happens on a GitHub-hosted runner. This
# script just triggers it (and tails it so you can see live logs).
#
# Why a GH Action instead of a local script:
#   - There is no longer a dedicated build host (157.90.162.154 was removed).
#   - GH runners are linux/amd64 with docker preinstalled (fast, free).
#   - Audit trail of every deploy in Actions UI.
#   - No PATs / secrets sitting on engineers' laptops.
#
# Usage:
#   cd vacademy_platform/ai_service && bash render_worker/deploy.sh
#   bash render_worker/deploy.sh --main          # deploy main even when on a branch
#   bash render_worker/deploy.sh --no-watch      # fire and exit, don't tail logs
#
# Prereqs (one-time):
#   - `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` should be green)
#   - The branch you deploy from must be pushed to origin (workflow_dispatch
#     resolves refs against the remote, not your local working tree)
#
# To roll back (any laptop with kubectl access to k3s):
#   kubectl -n default rollout undo deployment/render-worker         # one step back
#   kubectl -n default set image deployment/render-worker \
#     render-worker=ghcr.io/vacademy-io/render-worker:<OLD_TAG>      # specific tag
#   kubectl -n default rollout history deployment/render-worker      # see prior tags
