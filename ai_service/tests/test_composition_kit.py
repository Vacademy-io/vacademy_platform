"""Frame-composition vocabulary and the variety guarantees around it.

Context: "the layouts all look the same" was traced to the per-shot prompt
carrying hundreds of concrete lines about type properties and two lines of
adjectives about frame composition, while the workhorse card exemplar was a
centred hero+sub stack. composition_kit replaces the adjectives with an
assigned, concrete vocabulary. These tests pin the parts that can regress
silently: the variety rules, the fallback behaviour, and the fact that the
contract actually reaches the prompt.
