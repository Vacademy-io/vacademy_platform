"""Offline tests for the marks the annotator actually draws on a copy.

Both cases here are regressions that shipped a copy a teacher would reject:

  - the tick was drawn with its tail descending, so head, vertex and tail fell
    on one line and every "tick" rendered as a bare diagonal slash. The student
    saw no approval marks anywhere on 13 pages.
  - a note was written only if a free right-hand COLUMN existed. When the
    detected rows span the full width of the sheet — which is what a densely
    written script produces — that column is never there, and all 36 comments
    on a 13-page copy were silently discarded. Every deduction was left with no
    stated reason anywhere on the paper.

No network. Run:
