"""Guards for the layout failures that clipped rendered shots.

1. `.stage-drift` is documented to the model as a MOTION helper, so it also
   lands on containers that already have a layout. It used to carry
   `flex-direction: column`, which those containers almost never override —
   an intended flex ROW became a stack twice the frame height and its last
   line was cut off ("HUMAN PARTICIPAT/ION").
2. Nothing may render outside the frame, and no word may be split across
   lines. Both repairs live in the dispatcher's post-script sweeps.
