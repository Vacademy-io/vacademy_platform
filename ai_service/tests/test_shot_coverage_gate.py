"""A run that ships a fraction of its shots must not report COMPLETED.

Real incident: a 28-shot film delivered 20. Eight shots generated fine, failed
at the timeline-placement step and were dropped; two more shipped as empty
fallback frames — a few hundred bytes carrying only a GSAP fade, which renders
as a white screen. The run reported COMPLETED with an empty error_message, so
the only way to find a film missing its certificate reveal and its closing shot
was to open the editor and look at the timeline.
