/**
 * Declares the named, bounded executor for the bulk report export worker,
 * plus the explicit process-wide default for unqualified {@code @Async}.
 *
 * <p>History of the {@code taskExecutor} bean below: before this feature,
 * {@code taskScheduler} was the ONLY {@code TaskExecutor}-typed bean, so
 * Spring silently used it as the default for every unqualified
 * {@code @Async}. Adding {@code reportExportExecutor} made resolution
 * ambiguous, and Spring fell back to {@code SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor}
 * (unbounded thread-per-call) with a startup warning. Rather than leave the
 * platform default to that fallback, we pin it explicitly: a modest bounded
 * pool serving the release flow, AI-evaluation pipeline and other
 * unqualified {@code @Async} methods. Runtime-verified 2026-08-03.
 *
 * <p>Core 1 / max 1 on the export executor is deliberate, not a
 * placeholder: the Hikari pool is sized at 5 connections (plan C1), so
 * exactly one export worker process-wide is the concurrency budget this
 * feature gets. A queued job reports status {@code PENDING}, which the UI
 * must render distinctly from {@code IN_PROGRESS} (plan R4).

     * max here: ThreadPoolExecutor only grows past core once the queue is FULL,
     * so with queue 100 a "max" above core would never be reached in time.
     * 8 threads with the (now 20-connection) Hikari pool keeps drain rate above
     * arrival rate; the CallerRunsPolicy below is the overload valve — past 100
     * queued, work degrades visibly onto Tomcat threads instead of being dropped.
