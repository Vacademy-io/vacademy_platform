 * stays off the hot path. Both queries drive from
 * {@code idx_aur_institute_assessment (institute_id, assessment_id)} and reach attempts through
 * {@code idx_sa_registration (registration_id)} — see migrations V25/V26. Without those,
 * {@code student_attempt} has no secondary index at all and every refresh seq-scans the largest
 * table in this service, against a 5-connection pool.
 *
 * <p><b>Not touched:</b> {@code question_wise_marks}. Hardest-questions, the in-flight
 * leaderboard, and avg progress/marks are out of v1 precisely because they aggregate that table
 * across every live attempt on every poll, and it carries no index on {@code attempt_id}.
