    /**
     * Browse an institute's questions directly, rather than through their papers.
     *
     * Every filter is optional and NULL means "no constraint".
     *
     * All multi-value filters are passed as a comma-separated string and expanded with
     * string_to_array, NOT as a bound List with `IN (:param)`. That is deliberate:
     * binding an empty or null collection into a native IN clause behaves differently
     * across Hibernate versions, and the one place this codebase already needed to be
     * sure of it (tagIdsCsv in findQuestionPapersByFilters) uses exactly this pattern.
     * A plain string binds unambiguously.
     *
     * Other notes:
     *   - institute_id is the denormalised column added in V42. Questions predating the
     *     backfill, or belonging to no institute-linked paper, are NULL and simply do not
     *     appear -- which is correct for an institute's own bank.
     *   - kb ids and node ids are matched with the jsonb containment operator so the GIN
     *     index on source_meta is used. node_ids is an array inside the document, hence
     *     the array-wrapped right-hand side.
     *   - The tag and text filters are SEPARATE EXISTS clauses rather than one EXISTS
     *     with an OR across columns -- the latter degenerates into a per-row seq scan.
     *
     * No semicolons anywhere, including in comments: Hibernate splices its fetch clause
     * in at the first one it finds and the column indexes then come out wrong.
