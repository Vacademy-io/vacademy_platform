/**
 * Institute-level assessment aggregate for the scheduled reporting platform.
 *
 * Exists because the only assessment data admin_core could previously reach was
 * {@code /internal/student-analysis/assessment-history}, which is PER LEARNER — at
 * 7,000 learners that is 7,000 HTTP calls inside a scheduled job. This computes the
 * whole institute in one query so a report costs one call.
 *
 * Read-only. No writes, no new tables, no migration.
 *
 * <h3>Two marks columns, and only one of them means what it says</h3>
 * {@code student_attempt.total_marks} is the marks the learner ACHIEVED, not the
 * paper's maximum — it equals {@code result_marks} and equals the sum of that
 * attempt's {@code question_wise_marks} on every row checked. Dividing one by the
 * other therefore yields exactly 100% for every learner, which is what a first
 * implementation of this reported. The real maximum is
 * {@code sum(section.total_marks)} for the assessment, and against that the
 * platform average is 49%.
 *
 * <h3>Scores that cannot be trusted are excluded, not clamped</h3>
 * Two populations are unusable for a percentage and are counted separately instead
 * of being quietly folded in:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>assessments whose sections sum to a zero maximum (135 attempts in a recent
 *       60 days) — there is nothing to divide by;
 *   <li>attempts scoring MORE than the paper's maximum (53 attempts, ~2%) — most
 *       likely a paper edited after the attempt. Clamping them to 100% would hide a
 *       real data problem inside a plausible number.
 * </ul>
 * Negative percentages are NOT excluded: negative marking legitimately produces
 * them, and the observed floor of -25% is a true score.
