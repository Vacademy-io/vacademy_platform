/**
 * Request body for the native iOS "Sign in with Apple" login.
 *
 * The learner app obtains these from the native ASAuthorization sheet via the
 * {@code @capacitor-community/apple-sign-in} plugin and POSTs them to
 * {@code /auth-service/learner/v1/oauth/apple/native}.
 *
 * Note: {@code givenName}/{@code familyName}/{@code email} are returned by Apple
 * ONLY on the very first authorization per Apple ID per app — they are null on
 * every subsequent sign-in. The {@code email} claim inside the verified
 * {@code identityToken} is the source of truth; these convenience fields are a
 * first-sign-in fallback only.
