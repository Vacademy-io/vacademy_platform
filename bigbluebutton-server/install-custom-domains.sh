# Per-institute custom live-class domains (white-labelling)
# =============================================================
# Makes this BBB server answer for institute-owned hostnames such as
# meet.zoeedtech.com, in addition to its canonical pool domain.
#
# Usage:
#   bash install-custom-domains.sh <CANONICAL_DOMAIN> [comma,separated,aliases]
#
# Example:
#   bash install-custom-domains.sh meet.vacademy.io meet.zoeedtech.com,live.school.in
#
# Safe to run on every boot: every step is idempotent, and the script is
# written so the CANONICAL domain keeps working even if every alias step
# fails. An alias that cannot get a certificate degrades to a TLS warning on
# that one hostname; it never takes the pool server down.
#
# Ordering matters. This MUST run AFTER `bbb-conf --setip` and after the
# stale-IP sweep, because both rewrite /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton
# and would drop the server_name list this script installs.
#
# Requires (for certificate expansion only):
#   /etc/letsencrypt/cloudflare.ini   Cloudflare API token, DNS:Edit on the zones

# absolute, so an alias host would be bounced straight back to the canonical
# domain. Rewrite Location to whatever host the client actually asked for.
#
# This has to sit INSIDE each location block: the packaged config sets
# `proxy_redirect default;` per-location, which overrides anything inherited
# from the server level. The `default` line is kept and ours added after it,
# so upstream 127.0.0.1 rewrites still work.
#
# For the canonical host the rewrite is an identity transform, which is why it
# is safe to leave installed permanently.

# ── 1b. Rewrite the absolute URLs bbb-web advertises in its API index ──
# GET /bigbluebutton/api is the FIRST call the HTML5 client makes, and bbb-web
# answers with two absolute, canonical URLs derived from
# bigbluebutton.web.serverURL:
#
#   <graphqlApiUrl>https://<canonical>/api/rest</graphqlApiUrl>
#   <graphqlWebsocketUrl>wss://<canonical>/graphql</graphqlWebsocketUrl>
#
# The client uses both as bases for everything after. On an alias host that made
# every subsequent call cross-origin: CORS blocked the REST fetch (which is sent
# with credentials:"include"), and the websocket carried no cookie for that
# origin. The client showed only "Oops, something went wrong".
#
# There is no static value that is correct for two hostnames — a WebSocket URL
# needs a scheme, so it cannot simply be made relative. Rewriting per-request is
# the only thing that works for both. For the canonical host this is an identity
# transform, so existing traffic is untouched.
#
# An exact-match location wins over the packaged `location /bigbluebutton`
# prefix, so this overrides just this one endpoint and nothing else.

# ── 1c. Rewrite the absolute URLs inside the meetingStaticData payload ──
# The client fetches this once at startup and takes its media endpoints from it:
#
#   clientSettings.public.kurento.wsUrl = wss://<canonical>/bbb-webrtc-sfu
#   clientSettings.public.pads.url      = https://<canonical>/pad
#   meeting.logoutUrl                   = https://<canonical>
#
# kurento.wsUrl is the one that matters: on an alias host the client opened the
# media websocket against the canonical origin, where it has no session cookie,
# so audio and video failed with WEBSOCKET_CONNECTION_FAILED (1002) while the
# rest of the UI worked perfectly.
#
# These come from /etc/bigbluebutton/bbb-html5.yml, which is per-SERVER config —
# there is no value that is simultaneously right for two hostnames, so again the
# rewrite has to happen per-request.
#
# The packaged block caches this response with key "$uri|$meeting_id". Since the
# body now differs per hostname, $host MUST be part of the key, otherwise one
# institute's cached payload gets served to another and both domains break in a
# way that looks intermittent and random.
