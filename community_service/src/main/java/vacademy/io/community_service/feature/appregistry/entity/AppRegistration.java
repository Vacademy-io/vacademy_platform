/**
 * One white-label application tracked by the App Registration &amp; Store Management module.
 *
 * <p>The whole client-side {@code AppRecord} is kept verbatim in {@link #payload} as jsonb rather
 * than normalised into a dozen child tables. That is deliberate: the record's shape is driven by
 * the platform-requirements catalogue, which changes every time Google, Apple or Microsoft move a
 * goalpost. Normalising it would mean a schema change per store policy update, for data that is
 * only ever read and written as a whole document.
 *
 * <p>The scalar columns beside it are the fields that are stable identity/search keys, denormalised
 * so listing and searching stay index-friendly. Note what is deliberately absent: no rolled-up
 * status column. That rollup is business logic the dashboard already owns, and duplicating it here
 * would only create two versions that drift apart.
