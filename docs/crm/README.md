## Reading order for new joiners

1. **CRM_WORKBENCH_AND_SALES_DASHBOARD.md §1–2** — the two-database topology (admin-core vs auth-service) and why nothing can `JOIN users`. Every other doc assumes this.
2. **CAMPAIGNS_AND_AUDIENCE_MANAGER.md** — where leads come from.
3. **LEADS_MANAGEMENT.md** — what happens to them.
4. **LEAD_ASSIGNMENT_AND_COUNSELOR_POOLS.md** — who works them.
5. **RECENT_LEADS_AND_FOLLOWUPS.md** — the screens counsellors live in.
6. **LEADS_SETTINGS.md** + the rest as needed.

## The five invariants everyone trips on

1. Admin-core SQL **cannot join `users`** — hydrate identity via `AuthService.getUsersFromAuthServiceByUserIds` after the query.
2. `timeline_event.type_id` for `USER_LEAD_PROFILE` events is the lead's **user_id**, not the profile PK; `action_type` stores the enum **name** (`COUNSELOR_ASSIGNED`), never the human title.
3. Open lead = `conversion_status IS NULL OR != 'CONVERTED'`.
4. `lead_status` columns are `display_order` + `is_active` (boolean) — not `sort_order` / `status`.
5. There is **no `assigned_at` column** — it is derived from `timeline_event` on read.
