# TTS Speech Cache — replaying audio we have already paid for

**Status:** implemented 2026-08-22, **both switches OFF by default**. Nothing changes on any
call until `TTS_CACHE_SPEECH_ENABLED=true` is set on the box.

**What it is:** when the bot is about to speak a sentence it has spoken before — same words,
same engine, same voice, same delivery params — it replays the stored audio instead of paying
the vendor to synthesize it again.

**What it is not:** an approximation. Matching is equality on a SHA-256. There is no
similarity search, no prefix match, no nearest neighbour. One differing character is a
different digest and therefore a vendor call. Quality is never traded for cost.

Companion docs: [`AI_CALLING_SYSTEM.md`](./AI_CALLING_SYSTEM.md) §6 (the five engines),
§10 (billing), §11 (diagnostics).

## 1. Why

V421's own migration comment: **"TTS is ~65% of an AI call's marginal cost."** A scripted
agent says the same opening line, the same farewells, the same handbacks and much of the same
pitch on every call, and Sarvam bills ₹3.00/1k characters for each one, every time. At the
measured **779 chars/call-min**, a 5-minute Sarvam call is roughly ₹11.70 of TTS.

The latency win rides along and is not small: Sarvam's TTS TTFB is 0.20 s median but
**4.5 s p95** (`SLOW_TTS` fires above 3 s). A cache hit is ~0 ms. The opening line is the most
latency-sensitive utterance on the call — the runbook ties a greet later than ~2 s to the
caller's "hello?" cancelling it.

**Customer bills do not change.** Billing is per-minute against the agent's *configured*
engine by design (§10.2). This moves COGS only.

---

## 2. The one invariant

> A bad entry is not a one-call bug. It is served to every future call that matches it,
> forever.

Everything below follows from that. The bar for **writing** an entry is much higher than the
bar for reading one.

---

## 3. The key

SHA-256 over a `\x1f`-joined tuple (`ttscache.cache_key`):

```
TTS_CACHE_SALT | engine | model | voice | pace | temperature
               | sample_rate | rumik_term_map_version | text
```

- `text` is the exact string the **vendor** would receive — Rumik's Devanagari→Latin
  normalisation applied, outer whitespace stripped. No case-folding, no whitespace collapsing.
- `engine` is the engine **actually constructed**, read from `providers.engine_of(tts)`, not
  `ai_agent.tts_model`. `build_tts` silently falls back to Sarvam on a missing key, so the
  configured value would file Sarvam audio under a `google` key and serve the wrong voice.
  `_tag_engine` stamps it at each construction site for exactly this reason.
- Gender variants and lead names need no special handling — `sir`/`ma'am`, `rahi`/`raha`,
  `kaise`/`kaisi`, `Rohan`/`Aarav` are different strings, so different keys.
- **The key is global.** No institute id: identical text in the same voice is identical audio,
  so generic script lines hit across tenants.
- `TTS_CACHE_SALT` invalidates everything at once — the escape hatch if a bad blob lands.

## 4. The six gates

| Gate | When | What it requires |
|---|---|---|
| **G1** complete | before hashing **and again at `CallCandidates.add`** | the text ends in terminal punctuation (`.` `!` `?` `।` `…`), or is a registered fixed line. Re-checked at the counter on purpose: the count means "this WHOLE sentence was delivered N times", and that meaning must not depend on a caller remembering to filter |
| **G2** uninterrupted | during dispatch | no interruption between dispatch and completion of that sentence |
| **G3** actually heard | at call end | the sentence appears in the **played** transcript |
| **G4** healthy call | at call end | the verdict is not RED and carries none of `CRASH`, `BOT_SILENT`, `TTS_WEDGE`, `REPLY_UNPLAYED`, `STT_DEAF`, `REPLY_LOOP` |
| **G5** sound render | at render | whole number of samples, ≥ 200 ms, written `tmp` + `os.replace` |
| **G6** verified | at serve | the stored text equals the key's text, else it is a **miss** |

### G1 is load-bearing, not theoretical

pipecat's default aggregation is by sentence — but on `LLMFullResponseEndFrame` it **flushes
the aggregator's remainder straight into TTS** (`tts_service.py:705-719`):

```python
remaining = await self._text_aggregator.flush()
if remaining:
    await self._push_tts_frames(AggregatedTextFrame(remaining.text, ...))
```

That remainder is a partial clause whenever the response did not end on a sentence boundary,
and it happens routinely. Caching one would render half a sentence and then play it, whole and
standalone, to every future caller who matched it.

### G3 reuses a mechanism that already exists

`PlayedTranscriptRecorder` (`bot.py:449`) sits **after `transport.output()`** and records the
`TTSTextFrame`s the transport releases at playout position — text the caller actually **heard**.
`NoRepeatGate` already runs this exact containment test to un-record never-played sentences
(`bot.py:918-922`), added after live call `4b1a44b9`. Its comment states the principle
verbatim: **"'Already said' has to mean 'already HEARD'."**

The confirmation is whitespace-tolerant (`turntake.normalize_spoken`) because the recorder
space-joins per-word text frames. **The key itself stays byte-exact** — the two comparisons
answer different questions.

### Fixed lines are exempt from G3 and G4

The opening, farewells, nudge, handbacks, fillers and transfer-fail closing are *authored by an
admin*, not learned from a call. There is no call to have heard them on. They still face G1,
G5 and G6, which are about the audio rather than its provenance.

---

## 5. Live audio is never stored

A call contributes a **candidate key**, never bytes. Every blob is rendered off-call by
`ttswarm.synthesize`, through the same one-shot paths the `/preview.mp3` audition uses.

This is not fastidiousness. On `sarvam`, `smallest` and `rumik`, `run_tts` yields **no audio at
all** — it enqueues text and the audio arrives later on a receive loop, with no per-sentence
attribution, and a barge-in truncates the stream mid-sentence. A live capture on exactly the
engines worth caching would be a coin-flip between the whole sentence and the first 40% of it.
Rendering off-call makes truncation impossible **by construction** rather than by a check.

### When recording actually happens

Three distinct moments, none of them during a call:

| Moment | What is rendered | Latency to first hit |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent save** | the opening line, via `AiAgentSpeechWarmer` | **before call #1** |
| **Seconds after a call ends** | anything that just became due — `report.py` kicks the sweeper the moment it ladders | the **next** call |
| **Every 5 min** | backstop tick, plus eviction | — |

The kick is why the sweeper is event-driven rather than a plain 5-minute loop: a sentence that
qualified on call N should be available on call N+1, not five minutes of calls later. The
sweeper defers when the box is at half its concurrent-call cap or above — synthesis is mostly
network but the decode is real CPU on a 1 vCPU node, and background work must never be why a
live caller hears a glitch. The periodic tick then catches up during a lull.

**Admission:** a key is rendered after `TTS_CACHE_MIN_SEEN` (default 2) qualifying sightings,
so a sentence first hits on its third. Break-even is 3 uses. This is also what makes caching
name-bearing sentences affordable: a one-off personalised sentence costs zero disk and zero
extra vendor spend, while a first name that recurs across a lead list is picked up
automatically.

### Barge-in is unchanged

The absorb-vs-interrupt decision (`turntake.mid_reply_action`) reads the **caller's words** and
knows nothing about where the bot's audio came from. A cached utterance ducks, absorbs and
cancels exactly as a synthesized one does — a bare "haan"/"achha" resumes the reply mid-sentence,
a question or anything unrecognised cancels it.

One thing the cache had to be careful about: a cached blob is available *all at once*, and
emitting it in a single burst would push the whole utterance past `DuckGate` into the output
queue before the caller had drawn breath — reproducing the condition that made barge-in feel
slow before `AUDIO_MAX_LEAD_SECS` (live call `d6e82def`: *"dropping 0 held frame(s)"* on an
interrupt, 1.96 s of measured talk-over). So the cached path emits at **~2× real time**, the
same rate pipecat's own websocket output uses, keeping frames in `DuckGate`'s reach for the
whole utterance. It costs nothing in playback latency — the transport paces the line either way.

A sentence the caller barged over is **not** laddered (G2), so an interrupted utterance never
counts toward the render threshold.

---

## 6. Ordering — the hazard, and the guard

pipecat 1.4 orders audio through a `_serialization_queue` of audio contexts drained in
creation order (`tts_service.py:1430`). But **`reuse_context_id_within_turn` defaults to
`True`** (`tts_service.py:184`), so `create_context_id()` returns the *same* `_turn_context_id`
for every sentence of a turn. `_refresh_audio_context` only pushes a keepalive sentinel; it
does **not** create a new ordering slot.

⇒ On the async-arrival engines, all sentences of a turn share **one FIFO drained in append
order**. Cached audio appends instantly; vendor audio appends 200–400 ms later. So a cached
sentence served mid-turn would be heard **before** a vendor sentence requested earlier —
intermittently, only on partial-hit turns, which is the worst failure shape there is.

Worse, `TTSStoppedFrame` + `remove_audio_context` are owned by the vendor's receive loop
(`sarvam/tts.py:1180`). A cached path emitting its own would close the turn's context early and
later vendor audio would be dropped with *"unable to append audio to context"* — lost speech.

**The guard (`TtsTurnWatcher`):** one boolean, set when a sentence is dispatched to an
async-arrival engine and cleared when a `TTSStoppedFrame` / interruption / cancel passes.
**On those engines, serve from cache only when it is clear.** Cannot reorder by construction,
touches no pipecat internals, changes nothing for existing agents.

It costs less than it sounds: the **first sentence of every turn** always has it clear (and
that is the sentence gating TTFB), every standalone `TTSSpeakFrame` has it clear, and a later
sentence is cacheable exactly when every preceding one also hit.

| Engine | `run_tts` shape | Mid-turn caching |
|---|---|---|
| `google`, `edge`, `deepgram` | HTTP generator, own start/stop **per sentence** | unrestricted |
| `sarvam`, `smallest`, `rumik` | enqueue; audio arrives out-of-band, **turn-level** brackets | only when `vendor_inflight` is clear |

> **Considered and deferred:** setting `reuse_context_id_within_turn=False` would give
> per-sentence contexts and therefore unrestricted mid-turn caching on every engine — and
> `google` already behaves that way in production, so the pipeline handles the shape. It was
> not taken because it changes `BotStartedSpeaking`/`BotStoppedSpeaking` to fire per sentence
> for the paying legacy Sarvam agents, touching `DuckGate`, the watchdog and dead-air
> measurement. Worth trialling on one agent once the ledger shows what the degradation costs.

## 7. Where it lives

```
/tmp/tts-cache/                     ← Docker volume tts_cache; survives restarts and CI rolls
└── speech/                         ← NEW namespace, its own budget
    ├── {sha256}.pcm                ← the audio: raw s16le mono @ 8 kHz
    ├── {sha256}.json               ← sidecar: engine, voice, params, text, chars, ms
    └── ledger.db                   ← SQLite WAL: `seen` (candidates) + `blob` (index source)
```

Three stores, three jobs:

| Store | Job |
|---|---|
| **blob store** | the audio. The hash **is** the filename — content-addressed, no lookup table |
| **RAM index** | `dict[key] → Entry`, rebuilt at startup from ONE query. The hot-path lookup is a dict get: no syscall, nothing that can block the event loop |
| **ledger** | candidate keys not yet rendered, plus the blob metadata the index is built from |

Blob metadata is in SQLite rather than re-read from sidecars so startup is one query instead of
tens of thousands of file opens. The sidecars remain as a debug artefact and a rebuild source.

**Eviction** is by **(hits ASC, last-served ASC)**, not plain LRU: a line hit 500 times is the
whole point and must outlive write-once junk — the same reasoning that already protects warmed
IVR prompts in `_evict_tts_cache`. That existing sweep only matches `*.mp3`, which is precisely
why this namespace needs its own.

Sizing: 8 kHz s16 = 16 KB/s, so a 4-second sentence ≈ 64 KB and 2 GB ≈ ~32,000 sentences.
Storing at the Plivo leg's own rate rather than the engine's 24 kHz is 3× smaller and removes a
resample from the hot path.

> ⚠️ **The Singapore fallback gets no cache.** `voice-bot-service-deployment.yaml` declares no
> `volumes:` and `values.yaml` sets `replicaCount: 2`. If `VOICE_BOT_BASE_URL` is ever cut over
> there, the cache is ephemeral, unshared between the two replicas, and the ledger splits (a
> sentence would need ~4 sightings, not 2). Nothing breaks — every miss is today's behaviour —
> it just silently stops saving money.

---

## 8. Warm-on-save

`AiAgentSpeechWarmer` (admin core) posts an agent's fixed lines to
`POST /voice-bot-service/internal/tts-cache/warm` when the agent is saved, so they hit from
call #1 rather than being learned slowly. Fire-and-forget, modelled on `IvrPromptWarmer`: it
spends money and crosses an ocean, and an admin pressing Save must never see either.

Gated by `X-Voice-Bot-Token` = `VOICE_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET`, the secret admin core already holds
for minting `/ws` tokens. Not public: each warm is a vendor synthesis.

**An opening containing `{{leadName}}` is deliberately not warmed** — it is filled per call, so
the audio would never be reused. It is picked up by the learn path once a given name recurs.

---

## 9. Reporting

**Per call, no migration.** `diagnostics.tts` gains `cacheHits`, `cacheMisses`,
`cacheCharsSaved`, `cacheSecsSaved`, `cacheHitRate`. The blob is posted verbatim, stored in
`ai_call_result.diagnostics` (jsonb) and rendered by `CallHealthSheet` under **Speech cache**.

**Honesty discipline (§11.3):** cache off or unreadable ⇒ `null`, **never 0**. A zero must mean
"measured, nothing hit". Both counters arm together on the first observation, so
"hits 0, misses 12" is a real reading.

**The panel is hidden unless the cache actually ran on that call.** `CallDetailService` derives
`ttsCacheActive` from the blob (`tts.cacheHits != null`) and the sheet renders the section only
when it is true. The decision is the backend's, not the UI's: every agent is `OFF` by default,
and a grid of "not measured" on every call would advertise a feature the institute has not
enabled while pushing the rows that matter off the screen. It is also the *honest* answer per
call — a call placed before the agent was switched on genuinely had no cache, whatever the
agent's mode says today, which is why this reads the recorded blob rather than joining
`ai_agent.speech_cache_mode`.

Note `cacheHits: 0` still shows the panel: the cache ran and served nothing, which is a real
reading. That distinction is the entire reason the bot writes `null` rather than `0`, and a
plain truthiness test in the UI would have thrown it away.

**Rupees** are derived in admin core, which is where the rates are:

```
₹ saved = charsSaved / 779 × voice_call_rate_card["tts_<engine>"]
```

779 chars/call-min is the rate card's **own** documented basis (`tts_google` 2.06 and
`tts_sarvam` 2.34 are both that figure × the vendor price, per V428), so the savings number
cannot drift from the cost number. Null on `edge` (free) and `smallest` (no confirmed invoice
rate) — there a hit buys latency, not rupees.

**The ledger readout** — `GET /voice-bot-service/internal/tts-cache/stats` — reports distinct
sentences, total sightings and how many ever repeated. That is the number that says whether the
LLM-sentence half earns its complexity.

---

## 10. Configuration

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **`ai_agent.speech_cache_mode`** | `OFF` | **the actual on switch** — per agent, in the UI. OFF / FIXED / FULL |
| `TTS_CACHE_SPEECH_ENABLED` | `true` | ops KILL switch for the fixed-line path |
| `TTS_CACHE_LLM_ENABLED` | `true` | ops KILL switch for the LLM-sentence path |
| `TTS_CACHE_AGENTS` | *(empty)* | optional extra ops restriction. Empty = no restriction |
| `TTS_CACHE_SALT` | `v1` | bump to invalidate everything |
| `TTS_CACHE_MIN_SEEN` | `2` | qualifying sightings before one render is spent |
| `TTS_SPEECH_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` | 2 GB | own eviction budget |
| `TTS_CACHE_MIN_BLOB_MS` | `200` | G5 floor |

---

## 10.1 Rollout — per agent, from the backend

**What turns the cache on is `ai_agent.speech_cache_mode` (V466), set per agent.** Not an env
var: the bot's env switches are process-wide, and
rolling out to one agent, watching a batch, then widening is the shape this needs. No ssh, no
container restart, and the decision is visible to whoever later asks why one agent sounds
different from another.

| Mode | Serves from cache | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `OFF` | nothing | **the default for every existing agent** — the feature is inert |
| `FIXED` | the bot's authored lines only — opening, farewells, handbacks, fillers | first tier. Each is a standalone utterance with no join to a neighbouring sentence, so §11 cannot bite. Safe on every engine |
| `FULL` | the above **plus** the LLM's own sentences | only after the §11 render-parity listen for that engine |

> **There is no UI control for this yet.** `AiAgentDTO.speechCacheMode` is accepted, persisted
> and returned by `POST /v1/telephony/ai-agents`, so the agent API can set it — but the AI
> Agents page has no dropdown. Until one is added, enabling an agent means SQL (or a PUT
> carrying the field). That is deliberate for now: a rollout control nobody can click by
> accident is the right shape for a feature in its first week.

```sql
-- one agent, fixed lines only
UPDATE ai_agent SET speech_cache_mode = 'FIXED' WHERE id = '<agent-id>' RETURNING id, name, speech_cache_mode;
-- later, once the parity listen passes for its engine
UPDATE ai_agent SET speech_cache_mode = 'FULL'  WHERE id = '<agent-id>' RETURNING id, name, speech_cache_mode;
-- roll back instantly
UPDATE ai_agent SET speech_cache_mode = 'OFF'   WHERE id = '<agent-id>' RETURNING id, name, speech_cache_mode;
```

Rolling back takes effect on the **next call** — the mode rides the call context, which is
fetched per call. Calls already in progress are unaffected.

### The env switches are KILL switches

`TTS_CACHE_SPEECH_ENABLED` and `TTS_CACHE_LLM_ENABLED` default **true** and exist so ops can
stop the feature fleet-wide in one restart without editing any institute's configuration.
They enable nothing on their own: every agent's mode defaults to `OFF`.

`TTS_CACHE_AGENTS` is an optional extra ops restriction (pin to named agents regardless of the
DB), normally left empty.

### Nothing changes until an agent is switched on

The strong form of this claim is not "my code decides to do nothing" — it is **"my code never
runs"**. For an agent nobody has enabled:

1. V466 stamps `OFF` on **every existing row**, and the column defaults `OFF`.
2. The call context **always** emits `speech_cache_mode`, never conditionally — a dropped key
   would otherwise fall back to a bot default, and the only safe default here is `OFF`.
3. **`install_tts_cache` returns `None` without touching `tts.run_tts`.** The engine's own
   method stays bound, so there is no wrapper, no extra async-generator layer and no
   normalise call on the hot path.
4. **The `TtsTurnWatcher` processor is absent from the pipeline**, so the frame chain is
   byte-identical to today.
5. **`outcome.tts_candidates` is left `None`**, so `report.py` returns immediately instead of
   spawning a thread per call to flush an empty list.
6. `AiAgentSpeechWarmer` returns before any I/O for an `OFF` agent, so saving an agent does
   not spend a vendor render either.

Points 3, 4 and 5 are asserted by `test_a_disabled_agent_gets_no_wrapper_at_all`, which checks
`tts.run_tts is` the engine's original function — identity, not behaviour. Its counterpart
`test_an_enabled_agent_does_get_the_wrapper` exists because otherwise the feature could go
silently dead and every other test would still pass.

An `OFF` agent also writes nothing to the ledger — so switching an agent to `FULL` starts its
learning from zero, by design: we do not pay to render audio for agents that may never use it.

### Confirming which gates are open

The first log line of every call:

```
tts-cache: installed engine=sarvam voice=priya agent=Aarushi mode=FIXED rollout=in
           kill_speech=True kill_llm=True async_arrival=True entries=14
```

`mode=OFF` is the answer to "why did this call not hit the cache" nine times out of ten.

---

## 11. Before setting an agent to FULL: the render-parity check

**This is the one real quality risk and no test can settle it.**

Cached audio comes from the **one-shot HTTP** path; live audio from the **streaming websocket**
path. For the same text, voice and pace these are probably near-identical — but Sarvam's
`min_buffer_size` and `enable_preprocessing` apply to streaming only, and **`temperature` makes
bulbul non-deterministic**, so two renders of one sentence differ in prosody by design.

Neither produces wrong *words*. The risk is an audible seam where a cached sentence joins a
live one inside a turn.

**Per engine, before enabling:** synthesize one sentence both ways, listen back to back, then
listen to a spliced pair. An engine that shows an audible seam stays on fixed lines only —
those are whole standalone utterances, so no join exists. **Do `sarvam` first**: it is the
priciest engine and the one whose renders are non-deterministic.

---

## 12. Expectations

| | |
|---|---|
| Fixed lines | ~10–15% of TTS chars on a 5-min call, from call #1 (minus any `{{leadName}}` opening) |
| LLM sentences | **Unknown until the ledger runs.** `NoRepeatGate` needed *fuzzy* matching at 0.80 precisely because exact repeats were not frequent enough, and paraphrases of one question score ~0.6. Plan for 15–35%, not 60% |
| Ramp | starts near zero and climbs. G3/G4 make "qualifying" stricter than "spoken", so it climbs slower than a naive model predicts |
| Where money is at stake | `sarvam` (₹2.34/min) and high-volume `google` (₹2.06/min past its 1M chars/month free tier ≈ 1,284 call-min). `edge` is free, `rumik` ₹0.45/min |
| **The bigger lever** | not the cache — script determinism. `AI_CALL_ACTIONS.md` §10 flags the prompt at ~19k chars with the two-sentence turn cap not holding. A tighter script fixes that bug **and** raises the exact-match rate from the same edit |
