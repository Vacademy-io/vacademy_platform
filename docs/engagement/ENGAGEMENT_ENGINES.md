# Vacademy Engagement Engines — Design

> **Status: DESIGN LOCKED 2026-07-17. Phase 0 (ledger integrity) + Phase 1a (the read-only brain)
> BUILT + adversarially reviewed 2026-07-17 — compiles clean across notification/admin_core/
> assessment/auth, NOT deployed.** Phase 0: 15 findings fixed (§6.5). Phase 1a: two review passes
> (22 + 6 findings, incl. a runtime-fatal SQL bug the compile hid, cross-tenant IDOR, a
> lease-outrun double-decide, and a quiet-hours floor-disable) all fixed or recorded (§15).
> Grounded in a verified 10-area recon, three competing architectures, three adversarial red-team
> passes, and a 24-question founder interview (§0.1). Every class/table/endpoint named here was
> read in source. Where the recon was wrong, this doc says so (Appendix).
>
> **Migrations claimed:** notification_service **V31** (correlation_id); admin_core **V386**
> (5 engagement tables — V385 was taken by an unrelated feature). New internal endpoints:
> `POST …/notification-service/internal/v1/engagement/ledger-batch`,
> `POST …/assessment-service/internal/student-analysis/assessment-history/batch`,
> `POST …/auth-service/internal/v1/analytics/student-login-stats/batch` (HMAC).
> **Deploy note:** admin_core JVM must stay UTC (the sweep/lease math + naive-UTC timestamp
> binding depend on it — see the known IST bug).

## 0. What this is

A per-institute AI brain that decides **when** to message **whom**, with **what**, across WhatsApp,
email, in-app and (later) AI voice — reading an evolving set of data points, obeying a hard
institute-wide frequency cap, and either doing it automatically or handing a human a ready-to-send
suggestion.

**Phase 1 is a copilot, not an autopilot.** The engine decides and drafts; a human reads and presses
send. The one exception is opt-in: inside the 24-hour window a learner opens by replying, the AI may
answer on its own.

### 0.1 Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Choice |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Where the brain runs | **admin_core_service (Java)**, not ai_service. §2 |
| D2 | Workflow engine | Take its seams; **decline its interpreter**. New feature package. |
| D3 | Scheduler | Per-member `next_action_at` + **lease** under `SKIP LOCKED`, driven by an engine `next_due_at` cursor. Deterministic `shouldWake()` before any LLM call. §4 |
| D4 | Data points | Spring `List<DataPointProvider>`; `fetch(List<subject>)` — N+1 unrepresentable. **All 7 in V1.** §5 |
| D5 | Ledger | `notification_log.correlation_id` (V31) + capture the **wamid**. Phase 0, blocks everything. §6 |
| D6 | Tasks | New `engagement_action` = decision + ledger + task + audit, one row. **No assignment in Phase 1**; actions are ACK / DONE / **send-on-behalf**. **No volume cap** — rank and filter in UI. §7 |
| D7 | Prompt | Immutable `base_text` + append-only deltas → compiled. **Free text + AI clarifying interview.** §8 |
| D8 | Templates | **AI recommends → user approves → Meta → wait → user reviews rejections/recategorisations → alternatives → satisfied → activate.** A real state machine, and the activation gate. §9 |
| D9 | Replies | WhatsApp inbound in Phase 1 (free today); **email inbound stays off**. Claim by Meta `context.id`. §10 |
| D10 | Auto-reply | **Opt-in per engine.** Free-form AI inside the user-opened 24h window. Grounded in the prompt only. Escalates on uncertainty/anger/money. Replies ignore quiet hours. §11 |
| D11 | Audience | **Learners AND unconverted leads from day one.** Leads need a new reachability path — `RecipientType.AUDIENCE` is converted-only. §3 |
| D12 | Engine scope | **Many per institute, one per objective.** Makes the institute-wide cross-engine cap mandatory. |
| D13 | Cadence | **The prompt decides.** A hard institute-wide cross-engine per-user cap is the only safety mechanism — enforced **before** the LLM call. §12 |
| D14 | Channels V1 | WhatsApp + Email + **In-app** (the only first-class read receipt in the platform). **No push** (unobservable). **AI call = task-only.** |
| D15 | Metering | **Log usage, don't enforce**, in Phase 1. Price before automation. §13 |
| D16 | Rollout | All institutes, **off by default**. Institute admin creates/activates. |
| D17 | Quiet hours | Institute compliance floor (9 PM IST cutoff, DND) + engine may tighten, never loosen. Replies exempt. |
| D18 | Language | **English, Hindi, Hinglish only.** (Hinglish is not a Meta language code — authored under `en`.) |
| D19 | Timeline | Engine activity writes `timeline_event` (JOURNEY / REACHOUT) → renders in the existing lead journey + student timeline with **no FE work**. |
| D20 | vs Announcements | **Coexist** — broadcast vs 1:1. But they share one 1000/day rate-limit bucket; surface engine consumption. |
| D21 | `engagement_trigger_config` (V8) | **Leave permanently.** Deterministic thresholds vs judgement — different jobs. |
| D22 | Naming | "Engagement Engine", registered via `getTerminology` per CLAUDE.md so institutes can rename it. |
| D23 | Success metrics | **All four**: learner activity, lead conversion, message engagement, team time saved. §14 |
| D24 | Action vocabulary | Extensible handler registry. V1 = reply + share links; **book meeting / update CRM are tasks for now**, handlers later. |

## 1. The seven facts that shape this design

All verified in source.

1. **WhatsApp read receipts already exist — the "impossible" verdict was wrong.**
   `MetaWebhookController` (`notification-service/webhook/v1/meta`) is **dead code**: not in
   `WebSecurityConfig.ALLOWED_PATHS`, and `/notification-service/v1/**` doesn't match it, so Meta gets
   a 401. Every doom-finding about it (untyped `WHATSAPP_STATUS_EVENT`, the 60s dedup that eats
   transitions, the stubbed signature check) is real **and irrelevant**. The **live** path is
   `CombotWebhookController` @ `/notification-service/v1/webhook` — permitAll, validates
   `hub.verify_token`, parses WhatsApp Cloud format. `CombotWebhookService.processMessageStatusFromWebhook`
   writes **typed** rows via `CombotNotificationType.fromStatus()`: `WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_SENT`/`_DELIVERED`/
   `_READ`/`_FAILED`, each with `source_id`=wamid, `source`=original log id, `user_id`/`institute_id` copied.
2. **…but the bulk send path throws the wamid away.** `WhatsAppService.logWhatsAppMessages:477-478`
   hardcodes `source="whatsapp-service"`, `source_id=templateName`; the provider returns
   `List<Map<String,Boolean>>` — success flags only. So `findOutgoingByMessageId` misses and falls back
   to *most-recent-outbound-to-that-phone*. **Aggregate read-rate works today; per-message attribution
   is a heuristic that degrades exactly where an engine hurts most.**
3. **Everything the brain must obey is Java, in admin_core.** `AudienceOptOutService`,
   `bounced_emails`, `UserAnnouncementPreferenceService`, `NotificationRateLimitService` (V181),
   `CallAiNodeHandler`'s shift planner, `LeadDistributionService`, and the credit tables
   (`institute_credits`, V100 — **admin_core's Flyway**). ai_service reads admin_core's DB but has
   **no Flyway** (12 hand-run `.sql` files under `app/migrations/`).
4. **The workflow engine's resume is broken for our purposes.** `WorkflowResumeJob.resumeWorkflow`
   calls `run(workflow.getId(), ctx)` — it **replays from the start node**, not `paused_at_node_id`;
   duplicate sends are prevented only by soft context flags. Plus `guard++ < 100` node visits/run and a
   serial unbatched poller. Its good parts: `NodeHandlerRegistry`, `NotificationRateLimitService`,
   `CallAiNodeHandler`'s `withinAnyShift`/`nextShiftOpen`, `WorkflowAiDraftService`'s validate→repair loop.
5. **The safe-concurrency pattern is already proven here, three times.** `claimForResume`,
   `LeadFollowupRepository.claimDueTransition`, `AudienceRepository.tryClaimAiCampaign` — all
   conditional-UPDATE claim-per-row. ShedLock **is** wired (V382, `masterDataSource`, `usingDbTime()`,
   8 jobs incl. `MetaLeadPollingJob` — supersedes the old "Meta poller fans out to 4 replicas" note).
   Quartz is `RAMJobStore` in **both** services: triggers, never replica safety.
6. **Three things the spec assumes exist, don't.** No human-task queue (`lead_followup` is
   `audience_response_id NOT NULL` with **no `assigned_to`**; `announcement_tasks` is *learner
   homework*). No AI-voice medium (`MediumType` = exactly `{WHATSAPP, PUSH_NOTIFICATION, EMAIL}`).
   No template auto-registration.
7. **Proactive WhatsApp = pre-approved template + variables.** Free-form is legal **only** inside the
   24h window a *user* opens — which is why D10 matters so much: it is the only place the AI can
   actually write.

---

## 2. D1 — The brain runs in admin_core_service

ai_service is tempting: it shares admin_core's Postgres and `call_intelligence_poller` is already this
exact shape. **Reject it.**

| Claim for ai_service | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| "Only Python meters fail-closed — `CreditClient.checkCredits` fails open" | The credit tables are **admin_core's** (V100). Read `institute_credits.current_balance` in-process; don't call the fail-open client. |
| "admin_core has no safe recurring loop" | ShedLock is wired (V382); claim-per-row is proven 3× in prod; `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is a **Postgres** feature. Conflates "Quartz is RAMJobStore" (true) with "no safe loop exists" (false). |
| "asyncio gives free I/O concurrency for LLM fan-out" | Real, and answerable with a dedicated `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` (`TelephonyAsyncConfig`, `announcementDeliveryExecutor` are precedents). These are I/O-bound HTTPS calls. **Do not use `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=4`.** |

The kill shot: **ai_service has no Flyway.** And every consent/cap/suppression/shift rule is Java —
reimplementing that set in Python is how you message someone who opted out. Precedent that closes it:
**`WorkflowAiDraftService` already calls Claude directly from admin_core** with a
validate→repair→strict-JSON-re-emit loop.

```
admin_core_service — the whole brain
  EngagementSweepJob  @Scheduled(60s) + @SchedulerLock   ← waste-reducer ONLY
    └ engine cursor scan (O(engines))
      └ per-engine member claim (SKIP LOCKED + 15-min lease)
        └ DataPointRegistry.hydrate(cohort)     ← 1 batched call per provider per cohort
          └ shouldWake(member, bundle)          ← DETERMINISTIC. zero tokens. kills most ticks.
            └ EngagementBrain.decide(...)       ← LLM, batched by engine (shared cache prefix)
              └ PolicyGate: consent → quiet hours → institute-wide cap → credits   ← BEFORE dispatch
                ├ Phase 1  → engagement_action(kind=TASK)  → inbox → human sends
                └ Phase 2  → EngagementDispatcher → POST /notification-service/internal/v1/send
  EngagementReplyJob  @Scheduled(2m)   ← durable wake for inbound (§10)
notification_service — actuation + ledger        ai_service — metering only
```

**Metering:** Java mints `action_id` **before** the LLM call and pins it across retries, then calls
`CreditClient.deductPrecomputed(..., idempotencyKey=action_id)` — idempotent via the
`external_reference_id` partial unique index (V243). This closes the double-charge-on-timeout hole every
HTTP-`decide` design had (they let Python mint the key, so a Java read-timeout retried with a *new* key
and charged twice).

CREATE INDEX idx_etp_engine ON engagement_template_proposal (engine_id, status);
```

`notification_service` **V31** (V30 is head):

```sql
ALTER TABLE notification_log ADD COLUMN correlation_id VARCHAR(255);
CREATE INDEX idx_nl_correlation ON notification_log (correlation_id) WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ux_nl_engine_corr ON notification_log (correlation_id)   -- at-most-once backstop
  WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL AND source = 'ENGAGEMENT_ENGINE';
```

**Why a new column, not `source_id`.** Two contracts want it and they're incompatible: the status
webhook joins on `source_id = wamid` (`findOutgoingByMessageId`); the engine wants `source_id =
action_id`. One column, two truths. `correlation_id` carries the action_id, `source_id` keeps the wamid
so the **exact** status join works.

**Reaching leads (D11).** `RecipientType.AUDIENCE` → `getConvertedUserIdsByCampaign` →
`findConvertedLeads` filters `user_id IS NOT NULL` — **unconverted leads are invisible to the entire
announcements path**. Since leads are a V1 audience, Phase 1 must add a lead reachability path:
resolve contact from `audience_response.parent_*` + `custom_field_values` and send via the unified-send
seam directly (the campaign path), not via announcements. Also note the centralized resolver **cannot**
resolve `ROLE` (roles live in auth_service's DB) — pre-resolve to USER ids first, exactly as
`RecipientResolutionService.preResolveToUserIds` does.

---

## 4. D3 — The scheduler (the answer to "won't this be bulky?")

Your instinct — *"if the level is high priority then only we check, else we put a future date"* — is
exactly right and it has a name: **cost scales with decisions, not with enrolled users.** A member is
invisible until `next_action_at <= now()`. 300k members on a 72h cadence is ~4k due rows an hour.

### 4.1 The loop

```java
// EngagementSweepJob — @Scheduled(fixedDelay=60_000)
// @SchedulerLock(name="EngagementSweep", lockAtMostFor="PT9M", lockAtLeastFor="PT10S")
//   ^ waste-reducer ONLY. The per-row lease is what protects correctness — and it survives the
//     lock expiring mid-run, which at LLM latencies it will.
for (engine : repo.findDueEngines(now, 25)) {                 // O(engines) via idx_ee_due
    var members = repo.claimDueMembers(engine.id, 200);       // §4.2
    var cohort  = registry.hydrate(engine.dataPoints, members);
    for (m : members) executor.submit(() -> decideOne(engine, m, cohort.get(m)));
    repo.bumpEngineCursor(engine.id, now);                    // fairness lives in the OUTER loop
}
```

Fairness must be in the outer loop, not the sort key. A single `ORDER BY tier, next_action_at LIMIT n`
with no institute predicate **is** the starvation mechanism — one 50k-member institute pins tier 0 and
the 200-member tenant who just enabled their engine sees nothing all day. A
`row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY institute_id …)` is worse: `LIMIT` can't push through it, so cold start
sorts *every* due row to pick 200 — the only design that gets **more expensive the further behind it falls**.

### 4.2 The claim: lease, not status-flip

```sql
WITH due AS (
  SELECT id FROM engagement_member
  WHERE engine_id = :engineId AND status = 'ACTIVE' AND next_action_at <= now()
  ORDER BY tier ASC, next_action_at ASC
  FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT :batch)
UPDATE engagement_member m SET next_action_at = now() + interval '15 minutes'   -- the LEASE
  FROM due d WHERE m.id = d.id RETURNING m.*;
```

**Never `SET status='CLAIMED'`.** A status flip is a *terminal state on pod death*: the row never
re-enters the due scan, the partial index hides it from every diagnostic query, and that member drops
out of the engine **silently, forever** — the worst failure class for an autonomous system, because
nothing tells you. The lease is immune by construction. `SKIP LOCKED` makes replicas *cooperate* —
strictly better than `WorkflowExecutionJob`'s collide-and-lose-on-unique-index. The lease's own risk
(a batch outrunning 15 min → double decision) is closed by §6.3, not by hoping.

### 4.3 `shouldWake()` — deterministic, and it must know what time it is

Where the money is saved: **most ticks cost zero tokens.**

```java
boolean shouldWake(m, bundle) {
    if (bundle.incomplete())           return DEFER;   // a failed fetch is NOT "no data" — §5
    if (bundle.hasUnansweredReply())   return true;    // always
    if (fingerprint(bundle) != m.wake_fingerprint) return true;
    if (cadenceElapsed(m, engine))     return true;    // ← THE ONE THAT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN
    return false;
}
```

**`cadenceElapsed` is the whole product.** Every digest-based proposal used
`hash(events + tier + prompt_version)` — *with no clock in it*. That hash is identical on day 7 and day
14 of silence. For a re-engagement engine **elapsed silence is the trigger**, so the gate goes quiet in
exactly the case that should fire, and `consecutive_no_ops` backoff then gives a learner who stopped
logging in **exponentially less** attention the longer they're gone. That's the product inverted,
defended as a cost optimisation.

**Quantize before hashing.** Raw values save money only where there was none to save: a dormant user's
raw digest is stable (you skip a call you didn't want), while an active user's
`PERCENTAGE_PACKAGE_SESSION_COMPLETED` moves every session so the digest changes every tick and the gate
**never fires** — the saving anti-correlates with the value. Fingerprint on *bands*: completion bucket,
days-since-activity bucketed 1/3/7/14, reply-count band.

**Jitter, always:** enrol with `next_action_at = now() + random() * cadence`. Without it, activating a
2,000-member engine is a thundering herd where the gate *cannot* fire (no `last_decided_at`, no
fingerprint) — 100% LLM on the first pass.

**Never put `prompt_version` in the fingerprint.** One admin edit would re-decide every member at once
(2,000 × 3 engines = 6,000 forced calls per edit), and a weekly autotune would do it platform-wide on a
cron — a cost control that periodically disarms itself. A new prompt applies at each member's next
natural wake.

### 4.4 Events pull rows forward

Polling stays lazy because events promote: a reply does
`UPDATE engagement_member SET next_action_at=now(), tier=0, window_open_until=now()+24h WHERE …`.
That's the tiering you described, driven by evidence rather than a schedule.

---

## 5. D4 — The data-point registry (all 7 in V1)

Same idiom as `RecipientResolverRegistry` — Spring collects `List<DataPointProvider>`; adding a data
point is **one new `@Component`, zero core edits**.

```java
public interface DataPointProvider {
    String key();  boolean alwaysOn();
    DataPointSpec declare();                                                  // label, cost, SENSITIVITY, schema
    Map<String, JsonNode> fetch(FetchContext ctx, List<Subject> subjects);   // PLURAL — N+1 unrepresentable
    String render(JsonNode payload);
}
```

`declare()` feeds prompt assembly, so a new data point becomes visible to the brain automatically — the
catalog-as-grounding trick `WorkflowCatalogController` already uses. Unknown keys warn and skip.

| Provider | Source | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger` *(always-on)* | `POST /notification-service/internal/v1/engagement/ledger-batch` — **new**, §6.2 | 1 HTTP / cohort |
| `profile` *(always-on)* | SQL: users + `custom_field_values` (`findCustomFieldsWithKeysByUserIdsAndInstitute`) | 1 query |
| `crm_lead` | SQL: `audience_response`, `user_lead_profile`, `lead_status(+history)`, `timeline_event`, `lead_followup` | 1 query |
| `enrollment` | SQL: SSIGM + `learner_operation.PERCENTAGE_PACKAGE_SESSION_COMPLETED` (a rollup — no computation) | 1 query |
| `calls` | SQL: `telephony_call_log` + `call_intelligence` dispositions/summaries | 1 query |
| `assessments` | `/assessment-service/internal/student-analysis/assessment-history` — **per-user today** | ⚠ **needs a batch sibling built** |
| `login` | `/auth-service/analytics/student-login-stats` — **per-user today** | ⚠ **needs a batch sibling built** |

**The last two are real Phase 1 cost.** Both are per-user endpoints; called per member they are an N+1
across a service boundary. Build `POST …/batch` variants first. Also:
`/auth-service/analytics/**` is in `ALLOWED_PATHS` → **permitAll**, so `student-login-stats` leaks any
user's login history by `userId` with no auth, despite the class being named `…InternalController` (its
path has no `internal`, so `InternalAuthFilter` — which matches `getRequestURI().contains("internal")` —
never fires). **File that as an IDOR separately; the new batch endpoint must be HMAC-guarded.**

**A failed fetch must DEFER the decision, never return empty.** This codebase's universal
catch→`List.of()` pathology (every `RecipientResolver` does it; a down auth_service yields "delivered to
0 users" with only a log line) is survivable for a human-triggered announcement and catastrophic for an
autonomous sender: a 500 from assessment_service and "this learner has taken no assessments" become
**the same input to the model**. Mark the bundle incomplete and re-lease.

`declare().sensitivity` drives a wizard consent checkbox and prompt redaction — piping a learner's
failed assessments into an LLM that writes to their **parent** is a conversation an institute must be
given, not defaulted into.

## 6. D5 — The ledger (Phase 0 — blocks everything)

### 6.1 Capture the wamid (2 files, no schema change)

Change the provider return from `Boolean` to the message id and set `source_id = wamid`,
`correlation_id = action_id`, `source = 'ENGAGEMENT_ENGINE'` in `logWhatsAppMessages`. That single
change turns `findOutgoingByMessageId` from *miss → most-recent-to-phone heuristic* into an **exact**
join, and the existing typed `WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_READ` rows become per-message truth.

### 6.2 One batched read endpoint

`notification_log` lives in notification_service's DB; admin_core cannot read it with SQL. So the
`ledger` provider is **one HTTP call per cohort**:

```
POST /notification-service/internal/v1/engagement/ledger-batch   (HMAC)
  { instituteId, subjects:[{userId?,phone?,email?}], since }
→ { bySubject: { <key>: { lastSentAt, lastReadAt, lastReplyAt, replyText, windowOpenUntil,
                          sends7d, reads7d, failures7d, lastFailureCode,
                          channelsObservable:["WHATSAPP","IN_APP"] } } }
```

`channelsObservable` is load-bearing: **tell the model what it cannot see.** Push writes *nothing* to
`notification_log` (hence D14). Email inbound is off (D9). In-app read receipts live in
`message_interactions`, not `notification_log` — join them in. If the brain can't distinguish *not read*
from *not observable*, it reads silence as rejection and escalates.

### 6.3 At-most-once at the sender

`UnifiedSendService` has **no dedup** — no key, no constraint, no check. A read timeout leaves the caller
unable to tell "not sent" from "sent, response lost"; then the lease re-fires and the customer gets it
twice. The gates don't save you (`notification_rate_limit` is 1000/day).

1. Mint `action_id`, write `engagement_action(status=PENDING)` **before** dispatch.
2. Claim: `UPDATE engagement_action SET status='DISPATCHING' WHERE id=? AND status='PENDING'` → 0 rows = someone else has it.
3. Stamp `options.source='ENGAGEMENT_ENGINE'`, `options.sourceId=action_id` → `correlation_id`.
4. On timeout → `status='UNKNOWN'`. **Do not auto-retry. Reconcile** via the ledger
   (`idx_nl_correlation` lookup), then settle SENT/FAILED.

**The dispatcher claim (step 2) is the ONLY at-most-once mechanism — deliberately.** The original
design also had a partial unique index on `notification_log(correlation_id)` as a "backstop"; the
Phase 0 adversarial review killed it (P0): `notification_log` is an observation log written *after*
the provider send inside swallowed-exception blocks, so a uniqueness violation there dedupes **rows,
not messages** — a legitimate retry after a failed attempt would send the message and then lose its
ledger row (and in a multi-row `saveAll`, take sibling rows down with it), leaving the ledger blind
right after a real send. Constraints on a log table cannot prevent duplicate sends; they can only
corrupt the record of them. **Phase 1a must implement the claim in the dispatcher.**

### 6.4 What Phase 0 actually shipped (2026-07-17, notification_service only)

- **wamid capture**: `ChatbotMessageProvider.sendTemplate/sendText` return the provider message id;
  `CombotMessageProvider.sendPayload` parses Meta (`messages[0].id`) and Com.bot (`message.queue_id`)
  shapes; `WhatsAppService` threads ids index-aligned through the bulk loop;
  `notification_log.source_id` = wamid (legacy `templateName` fallback for WATI/failures).
  `WhatsAppInboxService` also stores its reply's wamid now.
- **V31**: `correlation_id` column + partial lookup index (`idx_nl_correlation`). No unique index (§6.3).
- **Attribution, engine-gated**: `UnifiedSendService` threads `options.source/sourceId` (and email
  `userId`) **only when `options.source == 'ENGAGEMENT_ENGINE'`** — every other caller's rows stay
  byte-identical (announcements pass `source='announcement-service'`, which would otherwise have
  changed their row values and double-attributed per-user email views).
- **Correlation propagation**: the three status/failure writers in `CombotWebhookService` copy
  `correlation_id` from the original **only on the exact wamid join** — never on the
  most-recent-outbound-to-phone fallback, which could belong to a different decision.
- **Ledger-batch endpoint**: `POST /notification-service/internal/v1/engagement/ledger-batch`
  (≤500 subjects/call; fixed query count per cohort). Honesty fixes from review: `observable`
  read/delivery flags are **per-provider** (false for WATI — its status events land as untyped
  `WHATSAPP_STATUS_EVENT` rows via the other pipeline); `recentSends` excludes provider-rejected
  attempts (body `| Status: FAILED |`); `recentFailures` counts `DISTINCT source_id` (a Meta
  failure currently writes two FAILED rows); email matching is `LOWER()` both sides and excludes
  `source='announcement-service'` duplicate/failed rows.

### 6.5 Recorded, not fixed (pre-existing; revisit in 1a/1b)

- Chatbot executors (`SendTemplateNodeExecutor`, `SendMessageNodeExecutor`, `AiResponseNodeExecutor`
  → `ChatbotFlowEngine.logOutgoingMessage`) still write OUTGOING rows with `sourceId=null` and
  ignore the returned wamid — their status attribution stays phone-heuristic, as it always was.
  Correlation gating means they can no longer contaminate engine decisions. Fix opportunistically.
- `sendAttachmentEmail` carries no attribution — an engine action with an email attachment would
  write an unattributed row. Add the overload when the engine grows attachments.
- Batch outbound rows are saved **after** the whole send loop (100ms/recipient), so a fast status
  can still miss the exact join and land unattributed (correlation-gated → safe, just unattributed).
  Engine dispatch is 1 recipient/request, making the window negligible there.
- META institutes stamp `senderBusinessChannelId = meta.appId` — consistent with the send path
  (which uses the same value as phone_number_id), but an institute whose `appId` ≠ phone_number_id
  would write `institute_id=null` rows the ledger can't see. Pre-existing convention; verify per
  institute during engine onboarding.

### 6.6 Gate on failure — the escalation loop nobody modelled

`WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_FAILED` carries Meta codes (131049 / 130472 = quality-throttled). Ungated the loop is:
engine sends → WABA quality drops → sends fail → engine sees no READ → brain concludes "not read" →
**sends more** → the institute's number gets restricted, for every sender on it, OTPs included.
`PolicyGate` trips the engine to PAUSED and raises a task on rising `failures7d`.

---

## 7. D6 — Tasks: the Phase 1 copilot inbox

`lead_followup` is disqualified twice: `audience_response_id NOT NULL` (learners unrepresentable) and
**no `assigned_to`**. The helpdesk (`support_ticket`) models *Vacademy's own* staff — right reference,
wrong extension point. So `engagement_action` is new, and deliberately one row for decision + ledger +
task + audit.

**Phase 1 inbox — institute-wide queue, no assignment (D6):**

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Ack** | `status=ACKED`. Someone's on it. |
| **Done** | `status=DONE`, `outcome=ACCEPTED`. Handled outside the system. |
| **Send** | Human reviews `draft_body`, edits if they want, hits send → dispatches via §6.3. `sent_body` recorded; `outcome=ACCEPTED` or `EDITED`. |
| **Dismiss** | `status=DISMISSED`, `outcome=DISMISSED`. |

**Send-on-behalf is what makes Phase 1 valuable.** The engine drafts, a human sends. You get real
messages, a real ledger, and — crucially — the `ACCEPTED / EDITED / DISMISSED` labels that Phase 2's
automation and Phase 3's autotune depend on, with zero autonomy.

**No volume cap (D6, your call).** Every decision becomes a visible task; the UI sorts by `priority` and
filters. `expires_at` reaps stale ones.

> **Accepted risk, recorded.** At 50k learners on a 72h cadence that's ~16k due/day; even at a 90% no-op
> gate, ~1,600 tasks/day into an inbox nobody is assigned to. If it becomes wallpaper and gets
> bulk-dismissed, those dismissals are **indistinguishable from "the AI was wrong"** — and they're the
> exact labels Phase 2 relies on. Mitigation without a cap: `priority` ranking, `expires_at`, and a
> **dismissal-rate alarm** — if an institute's dismiss rate exceeds ~80%, stop trusting its labels for
> autotune and tell someone.

---

## 8. D7 — The prompt that grows

> *"this prompt will be remade with the initial things and whatever changes… a prompt that grows with time"*

`base_text` is **immutable**; each admin edit appends `delta_text`; `compiled_text` is deterministically
assembled. **Never re-summarize the prompt with an LLM** — that's drift-by-resummarization, and after
six edits the engine runs something nobody wrote.

**Creation UX (D7): free text + an AI clarifying interview.** The admin types what they want; the AI
interviews them on the gaps — cadence? which PDF/YouTube links? what counts as success? who's excluded?
should it auto-reply? — and compiles the prompt. The interview is where a vague brief becomes an engine
that works, and it feeds straight into the template proposal (§9).

- **Admin edit** → new version, `status=SHADOW` → sampled against ACTIVE, decisions recorded and diffed,
  **never sent** → admin promotes. Shadow mode was invented for the tuner, but the risky edit is a human
  typing *"be more aggressive about fee reminders"* — point it at admin edits too.
- **Autotune** (Phase 3) → same pipeline, `source=AUTOTUNE`, restricted to **narrowing** amendments
  (add a constraint, tighten a cadence) — mechanically checkable, so "the AI edited its own prompt" never
  means "the AI widened its own remit". Human approves. Tone is **not** auto-applicable: tone is brand.
- Show a **behavioral diff, not a text diff**. A text diff is engineer UX.
- Bound `compiled_text`. It ships on every request, forever.

---

## 9. D8 — The template negotiation loop (and the activation gate)

Your loop, as a state machine. This is a **wizard step**, and `status=TEMPLATES_PENDING` gates activation.

```
prompt compiled
  → AI RECOMMENDS templates (name, body, body_variable_names, proposed_category)   [AI_PROPOSED]
  → user reviews / edits / asks for alternatives  ──┐                              [USER_REVIEW]
  → user approves                                    │                             [USER_APPROVED]
  → createDraft + submitToMeta                       │                             [SUBMITTED → META_PENDING]
  → WAIT for Meta (hours→days; poll via syncFromMeta)│
  → META_APPROVED ──────────────────────────────────┤→ all satisfied? → engine may ACTIVATE
  → META_REJECTED / META_RECATEGORISED (utility→marketing) → user reviews ─┘  round++, alternatives
```

- **The LLM proposes `category`; a human always confirms it, and Meta may override it.** Templates are
  `MARKETING | UTILITY | AUTHENTICATION`; Meta re-categorises and rejects; low-quality marketing degrades
  the **phone number's** quality rating, throttling the institute's messaging tier (1K→10K→100K unique
  users/24h) for every sender on that number. An LLM labelling *"Join our new batch!"* as UTILITY to dodge
  caps is a **policy violation, not a rejection**. `META_RECATEGORISED` is therefore a first-class state
  that demands human review — exactly as you described.
- **Once LIVE, never pause for a new template (D8).** A prompt edit needing a new template keeps the
  engine running on already-approved ones; the pending template surfaces as a task ("waiting on Meta").
  Meta approval takes hours to days — pausing a working engine for it would be painful.
- Media headers: Meta rejects public URLs (subcode 2388273) — bytes go through `POST /{appId}/uploads`
  first. That flow already exists in `WhatsAppTemplateManagerService`.
- Write `body_variable_names` on the draft → `resolveTemplateVariablePositions()` gives semantic
  variables (`{"name":…, "payment_link":…}`) instead of positional `{{1}}` for free.
- **Language (D18):** `notification_template` is `UNIQUE(institute_id, name, language)` — so en/hi are
  separate approvals. **Hinglish is not a Meta language code**: author it under `en` with Latin-script
  Hindi body text.

**And say the quiet part in the wizard.** Proactive WhatsApp is template + variables. A dry-run screen
rendering `draft_body` as beautiful AI prose would be **lying about the highest-stakes channel** — for
WhatsApp, previews must render the *resolved template*, not the draft.

---

## 10. D9 — Replies

`ChatbotFlowEngine` and the legacy `channel_flow_config` router already compete for every inbound
message. A third claimant needs a rule **decidable inside the webhook** (notification_service cannot
query admin_core's DB):

1. Meta inbound `context.id` matches an engine wamid → **engine**. Exact, free once §6.1 lands.
2. Keyword matches a chatbot trigger → **chatbot**.
3. `ChatbotFlowEngine.handleIncomingMessage(...)` returns `handled` → chatbot.
4. Otherwise → engine.

Rejected: *"the system that spoke last owns the reply for 24h"* — engine nudges at 9am, learner texts
"FEES" at 2pm, and the institute's **paid-for Jumpstart chatbot is dead for 24 hours**.

**Durable wake, not fire-and-forget.** Best-effort HMAC POST to admin_core is the fast path; if it 500s
the wake is dropped and the slow path is `base * 2^5` away for a dormant member — a lead replying *"yes,
send me the fee structure"* would be answered days later, precisely for the replies that matter most.
So: fast-path POST **plus** an `EngagementReplyJob` doing a 2-minute
`inbound-since?instituteId=&since=` sweep per active institute (one cheap query) that promotes matching
members to tier 0 and stamps `window_open_until`.

**Email inbound stays OFF (D9).** The code is complete but `aws.inbound.email.enabled` defaults false in
**dev, stage AND prod**, and `SqsInboundEmailListener` is `matchIfMissing=false` — the bean doesn't
exist. Turning it on is AWS work (SES us-east-1, MX, S3, SQS, IAM), not code. Until then the ledger
reports email as not-observable for replies.

**Opt-out must be classified, not keyword-matched.** The STOP matcher was built for chatbot flows where
users tap buttons. AI-authored prose provokes AI-authored replies: *"no thanks"*, *"please stop"*,
*"band karo"*, *"who is this"*. Keyword matching sees none of them; the engine messages again in 48h;
in India that's a user report → quality collapse → WABA restriction. **There is an LLM in the loop —
use it to classify inbound intent for opt-out**, in the same pass as escalation (§11). Note also that
WhatsApp-native *Block* and *Stop promotions* never reach `UserAnnouncementPreferenceService`, so the
consent store will confidently say ALLOW for someone who already told Meta no.

---

## 11. D10 — Auto-reply inside the 24h window

**Opt-in per engine** (`channels.WHATSAPP.autoReply`). This is the only place the AI may write freely,
and the risk boundary is coherent: **the user started the conversation.**

| Aspect | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Grounding** | **The engine's prompt only.** The admin puts facts, PDF links and YouTube links in the prompt — exactly as you described. If it's not in the prompt, the AI does not know it. No fee data, no course DB, no knowledge base in V1. |
| **Escalate on** | uncertainty · anger/complaint · money (refund, negotiation, discount) · explicit ask for a human → `kind=REPLY, status=OPEN, outcome=ESCALATED` with the conversation attached. Same classifier pass as opt-out detection. |
| **Timing** | **Replies ignore quiet hours.** They messaged first; answering at 10 PM is courteous, not spam. Proactive sends still respect the floor. |
| **Can do** | Answer + share links from the prompt. |
| **Cannot do (yet)** | Book meetings, update CRM, register for batches → **emitted as tasks** (D24), with a handler registry so they become real actions later without touching the core. |
| **Window** | `member.window_open_until`; outside it, template-only. |

```java
public interface EngagementActionHandler {          // mirrors NodeHandlerRegistry
    boolean supports(ActionType t);
    ActionResult execute(EngagementAction a, EngagementContext ctx);
}
// V1: SendMessageHandler, ShareLinkHandler, CreateTaskHandler.
// Later: BookMeetingHandler, UpdateCrmHandler, CallHandler — drop in a bean, no core edit.
```

Every auto-reply still passes `PolicyGate` (consent, cap, credits) and writes `engagement_action` +
`timeline_event`, so a counsellor opening the lead sees what the AI said.

## 12. D13 — Safety, consent, cost

- **The institute-wide cross-engine per-user cap is the only safety mechanism**, because the prompt
  decides cadence (D13). It must be **hard** and enforced **before** the LLM call. Per-engine caps cap
  nothing: 3 engines × 3/week = **9 messages a week** to one learner, each engine correctly believing it
  was restrained. The first complaint is "why is it spamming?" and every audit log says it behaved.
- **Gate order: consent → quiet hours → institute cap → credits → LLM → dispatch.** Gating after the LLM
  pays for decisions you throw away.
- **Consent is a union, and it is fragmented.** `AudienceOptOutService` moves the user to an OPT_OUT
  audience and soft-deletes only their **most recent** active `audience_response` — a user in several
  audiences who opts out is still reachable from the others, and `sendAudienceMessage` performs **no**
  opt-out suppression at all (`// TODO: apply filters` — it sends to every active lead). Read the union:
  OPT_OUT audience + `UserAnnouncementPreferenceService` + `bounced_emails` (`email` UNIQUE with **no
  institute_id** — one complaint anywhere blocks that address platform-wide, forever).
- **Kill switch stops dispatch, not just decisions.** The dispatcher re-reads engine status at send time.
- **Rate-limit visibility (D20).** `notification_rate_limit` is `UNIQUE(institute_id, channel)`,
  `daily_limit=1000` — **one bucket shared with announcements and workflow sends**. An engine silently
  eating 780 of 1,000 means the principal's exam-day notice becomes "delivered to 0 users". Surface engine
  consumption; never treat rate-limited as a silent DEFER. (Also: the naive
  `UPDATE … WHERE reset_date=CURRENT_DATE AND daily_used<daily_limit` returns 0 rows for *capped*,
  *stale reset_date* **and** *row missing* — at 00:00 every engine reads "capped" and goes dark with no
  error. Insert-or-reset first; note `CURRENT_DATE` resolves against the DB session TZ while
  `NotificationRateLimitService` rolls it with Java `LocalDate.now()`.)
- **Quiet hours (D17):** institute floor from `VOICE_CALLING_SETTING` (9 PM IST cutoff, DND scrub) +
  `CallAiNodeHandler`'s `withinAnyShift`/`nextShiftOpen` extracted; an engine may tighten, never loosen.
  Replies exempt (§11).
- **Never inherit notification_service's auth posture.** It is effectively `permitAll` (`ALLOWED_PATHS`
  includes `/notification-service/v1/**` and `/internal/**`; `HmacAuthFilter` is injected as a field but
  **never added to the filter chain**) and identity comes from request-body fields. Engine CRUD lives in
  admin_core under JWT; internals under `/admin-core-service/internal/**` under HMAC.
- **Creator = institute admin (D16).** ⚠ Verify `InstituteAccessValidator` first — a known bug rejected
  **all non-root admins** across ~35 controllers; fixed (8f8b7ff75) but **not deployed**.
- **Membership reconciliation** (unspecified in every proposal): a nightly re-resolve, idempotent against
  `ux_em_subject`, that sets `status='EXITED'` when someone leaves the audience. Without it an unenrolled
  learner keeps getting nurtured by an engine whose entire premise is enrollment.

## 13. D15 — Cost model

Verified rates: **Opus 4.8 $5/$25 per MTok · Sonnet 5 $3/$15 ($2/$10 intro to 2026-08-31) · Haiku 4.5
$1/$5**. Batch API **50% off**. Cache reads ≈**0.1×**; writes **1.25×** (5-min TTL) / **2×** (1h).
Register `use_case='engagement'` in `ai_model_defaults` so the model is DB-swappable without a deploy
(default `claude-opus-4-8`; `credit_multiplier` already exists per model).

At 50 institutes × 3 engines × 2,000 members = 300k members, ~3k in / ~200 out per decision:

| | LLM calls/day | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| Naive: every member daily | 300k | not what we're building |
| `shouldWake()` gate (deterministic, **quantized**) | ~30–120k | zero-token skip. The single biggest lever. |
| + prompt caching, batched **by engine** | same calls, ~56% less input | 1 cache write + N−1 reads |
| + Batch API for non-reply decisions | same calls, 50% off those | ~60s latency is fine; replies stay sync |

**The cache floor is model-dependent and it bites hardest where you'd least expect.** Minimum cacheable
prefix: **4,096 tokens for Opus 4.8 AND Haiku 4.5**; 2,048 for Sonnet 4.6/Fable 5; 1,024 for older
Sonnets. A ~1,500-token compiled prompt + schema **silently will not cache** —
`cache_creation_input_tokens: 0`, no error. Pad the prefix past the floor with the `declare()` catalog we
already generate, keep it byte-identical across the engine's cohort (render order is tools → system →
messages; volatile per-member data goes *after* the last breakpoint), and verify with
`usage.cache_read_input_tokens` rather than assuming.

**On a Haiku screen-then-draft cascade:** mostly unnecessary — the deterministic gate already removes
the calls a cheap screen would remove, at zero tokens instead of some. It also collides with Haiku's
4,096-token floor, so the screen would run uncached. Keep it as a Phase-3 tunable.

**Metering (D15): log, don't enforce.** Write `credit_transactions` so you can see real cost per
institute; never block a Phase 1 decision. Before Phase 2, price it: add an `ai_tool_pricing` row
(`unit_field='flat'`) and **mirror it in `tool_cost_estimator.DEFAULT_TOOL_PRICING`** — V321 says so
explicitly and rates are already synced in three places. `ai_token_usage.request_type` is
CHECK-constrained (V325) with no `engagement` value: add a migration, or use `deductPrecomputed` (sends
no `usage_log_id`, so the CHECK never applies — the workaround already in use).

---

## 14. D23 — What the dashboard shows

All four metrics were selected, so the dashboard needs all four — and they have very different
attribution strength. Say so on the page rather than implying the engine caused everything.

| Metric | Source | Honesty note |
|---|---|---|
| **Message engagement** | ledger: read/reply/opt-out rate per engine, per template, per hour-of-day | Directly measured. Strongest signal, weakest business proof — and it's what the brain itself learns from. |
| **Team time saved** | `engagement_action`: created vs done/sent, drafts accepted-vs-edited, median time-to-handle | Directly measured. The clearest Phase 1 win: messages that would never have been sent otherwise. |
| **Learner activity** | `learner_operation` completion deltas for engaged vs not-yet-engaged members | **Correlational.** Needs a holdout to mean anything — see below. |
| **Lead conversion** | `lead_status_history` → CONVERTED, engaged vs not | **Correlational.** Same. |

**Hold out ~5% of each engine's audience.** Without it, "completion went up" is unfalsifiable and the
first sceptical principal will say so. A holdout costs nothing and turns two of your four metrics from
anecdote into evidence. `lead_status_history.source` is a free varchar — pass `'ENGAGEMENT_ENGINE'` so
engine-driven transitions stay auditable and distinguishable from human ones.

## 15. Phasing

Phase 1 grew during the interview (both audiences, all 7 data points, template negotiation,
send-on-behalf, auto-reply, in-app, WhatsApp replies). Splitting it honestly:

| Phase | Ships |
|---|---|
| **0 — Ledger integrity** ✅ **BUILT 2026-07-17** (reviewed, compiles clean, NOT deployed) | wamid capture end-to-end; `correlation_id` (V31, lookup index only — see §6.3); engine-gated attribution in unified send; exact-join-only correlation propagation; `ledger-batch` endpoint with per-provider observable flags + failure-code extraction. 11 files, 1 migration, notification_service only. **Deploy notes: off-peak (index build on the highest-write table) + mirror V31 into devops-baseline.** |
| **1a — The brain, read-only** ✅ **BUILT + 2× adversarially reviewed 2026-07-17** (compiles clean across admin_core/assessment/auth, NOT deployed) | **V386** schema (5 tables; note V385 was taken); sweep + per-row lease CAS + `shouldWake` (quantized bands + cadence clock); registry with 7 providers behind the SPI; **batched assessment + HMAC-guarded login endpoints** (sibling services); lead reachability (unconverted leads, which the announcements path can't reach); prompt v1 with immutable base + amendment recompile; engine CRUD + enroll/reconcile + task inbox (ack/done/dismiss) + data-point catalog. Engine decides → TASKs. **No sends.** Two review passes fixed 22 + 6 findings incl. a runtime-fatal null-cast SQL bug the compile hid, cross-tenant IDOR, the lease-outrun double-decide, and a quiet-hours floor-disable. **Deferred to 1b (the UI chunk): FE wizard/inbox, `channel-capabilities` aggregate, `<RecipientPicker>` extraction, token metering (LLMService exposes no usage yet).** |
| **1b — The copilot** | Template negotiation wizard + Meta state machine; task inbox with ack/done/**send-on-behalf**/dismiss; WhatsApp reply ingest + `EngagementReplyJob`; opt-in auto-reply + escalation classifier; in-app channel; `timeline_event` writes; dashboard v1. **Humans send; AI replies in-window.** |
| **2 — Automation** | Proactive autonomous sends behind `FIRST_N` approval; dispatcher + reconcile; kill switch; credits **priced and enforced**; holdout cohorts. |
| **3 — Reach + learning** | AI-call automation (new `MediumType` end-to-end); SHADOW autotune; `BookMeetingHandler` / `UpdateCrmHandler`; email inbound (AWS work); Haiku cascade if the numbers justify it. |

**Deferred, explicitly:** task assignment/routing (D6 — Phase 2+); push as a channel (D14);
`engagement_trigger_config` absorption (**never** — D21); cross-engine orchestration; sub-org scoping.

**DRY_RUN is a switch, not a mandatory week** — offer it, don't require it (a full loop with zero sends
costs real money producing nothing). Make `SIMULATED` **terminal**: on DRY_RUN→ACTIVE a week of
simulated actions must never be picked up by the dispatcher.

## 16. Open questions

1. **Task volume in practice.** No cap by choice (D6). Watch dismissal rate on the pilot institutes; if
   it exceeds ~80%, the labels are worthless for autotune and we need ranking or a cap after all.
2. **Credit rate per decision.** Blocked on Phase 2; anchor against `ai_call_out` = 5.0 cr/min.
3. **Hinglish template approvals.** Meta has no Hinglish language code; authoring under `en` is the plan
   — needs one real submission to confirm Meta doesn't recategorise or reject on script grounds.
4. **`/auth-service/analytics/**` is permitAll** — a live IDOR leaking any user's login history. File
   separately; do not design on it staying open.
5. **Sub-orgs.** `sub_org_id` exists on `audience`/SSIGM. Engines are institute-scoped in V1; revisit if
   sub-org tenants need isolation.

## Appendix — corrections this design makes to its own recon

Recorded because two independent agents made the same mistake, and consensus is not evidence.

| Claim | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Per-message read attribution is IMPOSSIBLE — the single biggest blocker" | **Wrong.** Both agents read `MetaWebhookController`/`WebhookEventProcessor` — a pipeline that is unreachable (not in `ALLOWED_PATHS` → 401). The live `CombotWebhookService` writes typed `WHATSAPP_MESSAGE_READ` with wamid + a join to the original. The real defect is one discarded return value in the bulk send path. |
| "Minimum cacheable prefix is 2,048 tokens" | Model-dependent: **4,096** for Opus 4.8 **and Haiku 4.5**; 2,048 Sonnet 4.6/Fable 5; 1,024 older Sonnets. Worse than stated, and it defeats the proposed Haiku screen. |
| "ShedLock doesn't exist / the Meta poller fans out to 4 replicas" | ShedLock **is** wired (V382, `masterDataSource`, `usingDbTime()`); `MetaLeadPollingJob` is locked. ~19 other `@Scheduled` jobs still fan out — see `docs/scheduler_infra/README.md`. |
| "ai_service has no Flyway, therefore no SQL files" | No Flyway, but 12 hand-run `.sql` files under `app/migrations/` — drift is invisible to tooling, which is the actual argument against putting the hot table there. |
