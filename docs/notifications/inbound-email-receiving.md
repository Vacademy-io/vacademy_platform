# Inbound Email Receiving

This document describes how inbound emails (replies from learners/users to platform-sent emails) are received, parsed, and stored, and what infrastructure must be provisioned in AWS before turning the feature on.

---

## TL;DR

- Inbound emails arrive at SES (us-east-1) → saved to S3 → S3 event triggers SQS → notification service consumes the message and writes an `INBOUND_EMAIL` row to `notification_log`, linked to the original outbound email by `In-Reply-To` header.
- The student communication timeline already supports `INBOUND` direction. New inbound emails appear automatically with a "Received via Email" label.
- Feature is **off by default**. Enable by setting `INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED=true` once AWS infra is ready.

## Architecture

```

    ▼
AWS SES (inbound, us-east-1)         ← MX record points here
    │

    ▼
SqsInboundEmailListener  →  InboundEmailService
    │                            │
    │   1. Parse MIME (From, To, Subject, Body, In-Reply-To, Message-ID)
    │   2. Dedup on Message-ID
    │   3. Rate-limit per sender (Guava cache, 10/min)
    │   4. Look up institute via email_address_mapping (To address)
    │   5. Reply linking: In-Reply-To → original outbound EMAIL log
    │   6. userId fallback: most recent outbound email to sender
    │
    ▼

| `features/announcements/service/EmailConfigurationService.java`             | When an institute adds an email config, also upserts a row into `email_address_mapping` so inbound replies addressed to that mailbox can be routed to the correct institute.                                                                                         |
| `features/communication_timeline/service/CommunicationTimelineService.java` | Added `INBOUND_EMAIL` to the type → channel/direction map; `EMAIL` channel now resolves to `[EMAIL, INBOUND_EMAIL]` for direction-based filtering; new `mapInboundEmailFields()` sets status `RECEIVED` and surfaces sender/recipient from the `messagePayload`.     |
| `application-{dev,stage,prod}.properties`                                   | New properties added (see [Configuration](#configuration)).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Frontend

**No changes required.** `student-communication-timeline.tsx` already handles `direction === 'INBOUND'` and `status === 'RECEIVED'` for emails (green left-border, ↙ arrow, "Received via Email" label).

---

## Feature Flag

The new functionality is gated by a dedicated opt-in flag — independent of the existing `aws.sqs.enabled` (which controls outbound SES event tracking).

```properties
aws.inbound.email.enabled=${INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED:false}
```

When `false` (the default):

- `AwsInboundConfig`, `SqsInboundEmailListener`, `InboundEmailService` beans are **not loaded**.
- Zero AWS calls. Zero log noise. The service starts identically to before.
- The only always-active changes are: the `Message-ID` capture in `EmailService` (purely additive — `sourceId` was previously `null` for outbound emails) and the upsert into `email_address_mapping` whenever an email config is saved (wrapped in try-catch).

This means the code is **safe to merge and deploy before the AWS infrastructure exists.**

---

## Configuration

### Spring properties (already added to all `application-*.properties`)

```properties
# Master flag — keep false until AWS infra is ready
aws.inbound.email.enabled=${INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED:false}

# Inbound region must be one of: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1
# (SES inbound is not available in ap-south-1 or other regions)
aws.inbound.region=${INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_REGION:us-east-1}
aws.inbound.accessKey=${INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY:}
aws.inbound.secretKey=${INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_SECRET_KEY:}
aws.inbound.sqs.queue-name=${INBOUND_EMAIL_SQS_QUEUE_NAME:vacademy-inbound-emails-queue}
aws.s3.inbound-email-bucket=${INBOUND_EMAIL_S3_BUCKET:vacademy-inbound-emails}
```

### GitHub Actions secrets to add

| Secret                         | Example value                                  | Notes                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED`        | `false` (initially) → `true` (after AWS setup) | Master switch                          |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_REGION`     | `us-east-1`                                    | Must be a SES-inbound-supported region |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | `AKIA...`                                      | IAM user (see policy below)            |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_SECRET_KEY` | `...`                                          | Same IAM user secret                   |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_SQS_QUEUE_NAME` | `vacademy-inbound-emails-queue`                | Queue name only (not URL)              |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_S3_BUCKET`      | `vacademy-inbound-emails`                      | Bucket name                            |

The workflow files already reference all six secrets — until they're set, they pass empty strings, which the properties handle safely.

## AWS Setup — Step by Step

> **Important:** All inbound infrastructure must be in **us-east-1** (or us-west-2 / eu-west-1). Existing outbound SES is in ap-south-1 — that region does **not** support inbound. The two are independent and can coexist.

### 1. Verify domain in SES (us-east-1)

In the AWS Console, switch to **us-east-1**, then:

1. Go to **SES → Verified identities → Create identity**
2. Add domain `vacademy.io` (and any other domain you want to receive replies on)
3. AWS will give you a TXT record + DKIM CNAMEs — add them to your DNS

### 2. Add MX record

For each domain you want to receive mail at, add this MX record to DNS:

```
Type:     MX
Host:     @           (or whatever subdomain)
Priority: 10
Value:    inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### 3. Create S3 bucket

```
Bucket name: vacademy-inbound-emails
Region:      us-east-1
```

Attach this bucket policy so SES can write incoming mail to it:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "ses.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::vacademy-inbound-emails/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:Referer": "<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>` with your 12-digit AWS account number.

(Optional but recommended) Add a lifecycle rule to delete objects older than 30 days — once we've parsed and stored, we don't need the raw `.eml` anymore.

### 4. Create SQS queue

```
Queue name: vacademy-inbound-emails-queue
Region:     us-east-1
Type:       Standard
```

Attach this queue access policy so the S3 bucket can publish events to it:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:vacademy-inbound-emails-queue",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::vacademy-inbound-emails"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Wire S3 → SQS event notification

In the S3 console:

1. Open the `vacademy-inbound-emails` bucket
2. **Properties → Event notifications → Create event notification**
3. Configure:
   - Name: `inbound-email-to-sqs`
   - Event types: **All object create events** (`s3:ObjectCreated:*`)
   - Destination: **SQS queue → vacademy-inbound-emails-queue**

### 6. Create SES receipt rule

In the SES console (still in us-east-1):

1. **Email receiving → Rule sets → Create rule set** (if none exists)
2. **Create rule** within the rule set:
   - Recipients: `vacademy.io` (and any other verified domains)
   - Action: **Deliver to S3 bucket**
     - Bucket: `vacademy-inbound-emails`
     - Object key prefix: leave blank (or use `inbound/` if you prefer)
3. **Activate the rule set** (only one rule set can be active at a time)

### 7. Create / update IAM user

The notification service needs an IAM user (or role) with permissions to read S3 + consume SQS.

Recommended: create a dedicated IAM user for inbound, separate from the existing `SQS_AWS_*` user.

Attach this inline policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::vacademy-inbound-emails/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>:vacademy-inbound-emails-queue"
    }
  ]
}
```

Generate access keys for this user → put them in GitHub secrets as `INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `INBOUND_EMAIL_AWS_SECRET_KEY`.

---

## Going Live

Once all 7 AWS steps are done and secrets are in GitHub:

1. Set `INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED=true` in GitHub secrets (or directly in the deployment env)
2. Trigger a deploy (push to `main` or re-run the workflow)
3. Verify in pod logs:
   - No errors at startup mentioning `inbound`, `S3`, or `SQS`
   - Look for `SqsInboundEmailListener` registration log line

---

## Verification

### Step A — confirm Message-ID capture (works regardless of inbound flag)

After deploying the code, send any email through the platform. Then in the database:

```sql
SELECT id, channel_id, source, source_id, notification_date
FROM notification_log
WHERE notification_type = 'EMAIL'
ORDER BY notification_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

`source_id` should now be populated with values like `<random-id@email.amazonses.com>` — previously it was always NULL for non-OTP emails.

### Step B — confirm institute mapping is being populated

After saving an email config in Settings, check:

```sql
SELECT * FROM email_address_mapping;
```

There should be a row matching the email address you just configured.

### Step C — full end-to-end inbound flow

Once `INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED=true`:

1. From the platform, send an email to a real mailbox you control
2. Reply to that email
3. Within ~30 seconds, check S3:
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://vacademy-inbound-emails/ --recursive
   ```
   You should see a new object.
4. Check SQS for any messages currently in flight:
   ```
   aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
     --queue-url <queue-url> \
     --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages
   ```
5. Check `notification_log`:

   ```sql
   SELECT id, notification_type, channel_id, source, source_id, user_id, body
   FROM notification_log
   WHERE notification_type = 'INBOUND_EMAIL'
   ORDER BY notification_date DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   - `channel_id` = sender's email address
   - `source` = the `id` of the original outbound email log (reply linking worked)
   - `user_id` = same as the original outbound email's user_id
   - `source_id` = the inbound email's Message-ID (used for dedup)

6. Open the student's communication timeline in the admin dashboard. The reply should appear with green left-border, ↙ arrow, status "Received".

### Step D — confirm safe failure modes

- **Wrong creds / non-existent queue**: SQS polling logs `QueueDoesNotExist` or auth errors but the service stays up. No impact on outbound emails.
- **Email to an unknown address**: Discarded with debug log (`No email_address_mapping found for To=...`). No DB row created.
- **Duplicate SQS delivery**: Second delivery is detected via `source_id` dedup and skipped silently.

## Edge Cases & Limits

| Case                            | Handling                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spam / unmapped recipient       | Discarded — only emails to addresses in `email_address_mapping` are stored                           |
| Duplicate SQS delivery          | Dedup on `source_id = Message-ID`; second delivery skipped                                           |
| No `In-Reply-To` header         | Stored standalone; `source = null`, `userId` resolved from most recent outbound email to the sender  |
| Multiple To/CC recipients       | First match in `email_address_mapping` wins; one log entry per inbound email                         |
| Body > 64 KB                    | Truncated with `[TRUNCATED]` marker; full body still stored in `messagePayload` JSON up to the limit |
| HTML-only body                  | Tags stripped for the `body` field; raw HTML preserved in `messagePayload`                           |
| Malformed MIME                  | Caught; row stored with `body = [PARSE_ERROR]`                                                       |
| S3 object missing               | `NoSuchKey` caught and logged; SQS message ignored (no retry storm)                                  |
| Spam/abuse from a single sender | Rate-limited to 10 emails/minute per sender (in-memory Guava cache, per pod)                         |

**Existing institutes**: rows in `email_address_mapping` are populated only when an email config is saved/re-saved going forward. To backfill, either ask each institute to re-save their email settings, or run a one-time SQL migration that copies addresses from the institute settings JSON.

---

## Rollback

If something goes wrong after enabling:

1. Set `INBOUND_EMAIL_ENABLED=false` in GitHub secrets
2. Re-deploy

The listener stops, no further inbound emails are processed. Already-stored `INBOUND_EMAIL` rows remain in the DB (they're not harmful).

To fully revert the code, the V24 migration adds the `email_address_mapping` table — to drop it, write a V25 migration. The `Message-ID` capture in `EmailService` is purely additive and doesn't need rolling back.
