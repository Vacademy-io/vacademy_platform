/**
 * LeadConversionBadge — a compact "Converted" pill shown against a lead that has
 * been enrolled into a course (user_lead_profile.conversion_status === 'CONVERTED').
 *
 * Enrolling a lead auto-marks it CONVERTED on the backend; the lead list defaults
 * to keeping those rows visible (rather than dropping them out of the pipeline),
 * so this badge lets a counsellor tell at a glance which leads are already
 * enrolled. Matches the emerald "Converted" accent used by LeadStageChip on the
 * board card, so the two surfaces read consistently. Renders nothing for
 * non-converted leads.
