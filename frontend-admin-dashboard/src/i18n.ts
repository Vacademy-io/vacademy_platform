// src/i18n.ts — i18next bootstrap (BCP-47 locales, lazy-loaded catalogs).
//
// Catalogs live in public/locales/<locale>/<namespace>.json and are fetched on
// demand by the inline backend below, so adding a language never grows the
// main bundle.
//
// They live in public/ (served as static files) rather than src/ (bundled)
// deliberately: as src/ modules the ~3,200 catalogs entered the Rollup graph
// and each became its own chunk, which added ~1.2 GB to the build's peak
// memory (4.9 GB vs 3.7 GB measured) and pushed dist from ~900 to ~4,100
// files. That was enough to make the CI builder thrash in `rendering chunks`.
// Keep them out of the graph.

 * Inline lazy backend. Production builds carry one merged catalog per locale
 * (locales/_merged/<lng>.json, emitted by the merged-locale-catalogs plugin in
 * vite.config.ts); it is fetched ONCE per language and every namespace read
 * resolves from it. Per-namespace files (public/locales/<lng>/<ns>.json) are
 * the fallback — that's what dev serves, and what production degrades to if
 * the merged file is ever missing.
 *
 * Why merged-first matters: namespace loads used to race first render, and
 * anything that captured t() output before its catalog arrived — useMemo with
 * [] deps, react-query fetchers passed t — froze raw keys permanently.
 * index.tsx awaits `catalogsReady` before mounting, so with the merged file
 * the race no longer exists.
 *
 * The `?v=` cache-bust matters: files under public/ are copied to dist
 * verbatim, so unlike hashed bundle assets their URLs never change between
 * releases. Keying on the app version stops a browser serving last release's
 * catalog after a deploy.
 *
 * NOTE: `/locales/*` must stay in the `exclude` list of public/_routes.json.
 * That file routes `/*` to the Pages Function, which answers unknown paths
 * with index.html — so without the exclusion these fetches would resolve to
 * HTML and every namespace would fail to parse.
