/**
 * The audit table bolds the *names* inside each sentence by matching the
 * description against an ordered list of patterns whose capture groups
 * alternate connective / name. Two things go wrong silently there:
 *
 *  - a looser pattern placed before a specific one swallows the specific case,
 *    so "assigned 5 lead(s) to Riya" bolds the wrong half;
 *  - a pattern with an even number of groups shifts the alternation and bolds
 *    the connective text instead of the name.
 *
 * Neither is a type error and neither makes a render fail — the row just reads
 * wrong. So the split is asserted directly.
