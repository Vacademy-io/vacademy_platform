 *   match the new list's windows, so the lead is not messaged. Right for fixing a misrouted form,
 *   archiving to a cold list, or quarantining junk.
 * - `RESET_TO_TARGET`: re-anchor as though the lead had just been created in the target list, so
 *   that list's sequence runs from day zero. This SENDS MESSAGES — it is the re-engagement case.
