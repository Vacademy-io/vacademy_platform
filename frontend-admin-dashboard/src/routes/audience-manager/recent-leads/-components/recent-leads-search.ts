/**

 * exactly what an institute's sidebar sub-tab is — turns `?statusExclude=1` into the
 * NUMBER 1. A plain `z.string()` then rejects it, and because validateSearch runs during
 * route matching the whole page dies on the error boundary before it renders anything.
 * That is what "Processed (Touched) Leads" was doing. `range=7`, `calledWithin=24` and
 * `calledCount=3` were all one sub-tab away from the same crash.
 *
 * The app's own navigations were unaffected: the router JSON-stringifies what it writes,
 * so its values come back quoted and already strings.
