/**
 * Starter use cases for AI agents.
 *
 * Each entry is a ready-made shape of an agent an education institute actually
 * wants — doubt solving, mentoring, parent updates, admissions — plus the three
 * or four questions we need answered before the prompt assistant can draft it.
 * The `brief` becomes the input to /ai-agents/assist/draft; `fallbackPrompt` is
 * what we save if that call fails (no credits, model down) so the flow never
 * dead-ends.
