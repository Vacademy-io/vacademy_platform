/**
 * Orchestration for "Submit evaluation": flatten the annotations → upload the
 * evaluated sheet → save the marks → release the result.
 *
 * This deliberately lives OUTSIDE the editor component. `pdf-editor.tsx` opens
 * with `@ts-nocheck` + `/* eslint-disable *\/`, so neither the typechecker nor
 * the linter looks at it — and this is the one path where a faculty's finished
 * marking either reaches the server or is lost for good. It is kept here typed,
 * dependency-injected and unit-tested instead.
 *
 * The guarantees, in order of importance:
 *
 *  1. **Marking is never lost in silence.** Every failure comes back as
 *     `failed` with a reason to show, and the in-memory work is written to a
 *     draft first whenever there is somewhere to write it.
 *  2. **The caller's busy flags always unwind.** `onStage("settled")` fires
 *     exactly once on every path, so the editor can never be left stuck behind
 *     a loading overlay with both Submit and Save draft disabled — a state whose
 *     only escape is a reload, which discards every annotation on the sheet.
 *  3. **A submit that reached the backend is never reported as lost.** Once
 *     `submitMarks` resolves, the copy IS graded: nothing afterwards can
 *     downgrade the outcome, and no rescue draft is written over it.
