/**
 * Route guard for the Sub-Organizations (Channel Partners) module.
 *
 * Neither /manage-custom-teams nor the per-sub-org drilldown had any route-level
 * check — they were reachable by URL for any signed-in user, with only the
 * sidebar hiding them. Now that a non-admin role can be granted the module from
 * Display Settings, the same toggle gates the route: admins always pass, everyone
 * else needs `subOrganizations.moduleEnabled` on their role.
 *
 * This is a UI gate. Row-level visibility is enforced server-side from the
 * caller's sub-org assignments, so a user who slips past this still cannot read a
 * channel partner that isn't assigned to them.
