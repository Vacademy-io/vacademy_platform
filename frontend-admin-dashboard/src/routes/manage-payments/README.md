# Payment Management

A professional payment management page for tracking and managing institute payment logs.

## Features

### 📊 KPI cards (`PaymentKpiCards`)
Four tiles, amount-first, shared verbatim with the Payment Dashboard so both screens report the
same numbers:
- **Total payment**: amount billed across every record in view
- **Collected payment**: settled (PAID)
- **Due payment**: still owed — PAYMENT_PENDING, NOT_INITIATED and any other unsettled status
- **Failed payment**: attempts the gateway declined

Each tile is also the status filter for the table below. The filtering happens client-side
(`classifyEntry`), because the API's `payment_status IN (…)` can never return the NULL-status rows
that make up part of "Due".

**Scope of these numbers.** They count *payment records* — money raised through a gateway or
recorded against a plan. Fees billed on an installment schedule live in Financial Management
(`aft_installments`), which `payment_log` knows nothing about, so an institute can be 100% collected
here and still be owed lakhs there. When that happens the page says so: Manage Payments prints a
one-line pointer under the tiles, and the Payment Dashboard shows a "Fee installment dues" band
(billed / expected / collected / overdue, institute-to-date — the endpoint takes no date window).
On an institute with no unsettled records at all, Total and Collected are simply equal.

### 🔍 Filtering

#### Date range (`DateRangeDropdown`, toolbar)
A single dropdown at the top of the page — Today / Yesterday / Last 7·30·90 days / This month /
Last month / All time, plus a custom two-date calendar. Presets are cut on local day boundaries and
sent to the API as UTC instants (`-utils/dateRange.ts`). The Payment Dashboard uses the same
control, so a window means the same thing on both screens.

#### Free-text search (toolbar)
Matches a payment when ANY of these hit: the payer (name / email / phone, resolved to user ids via
the auth service), the amount, the **invoice number** of an invoice covering the payment, or the
**payment plan** name. Debounced 400ms and resolved entirely server-side, so it works across the
whole result set rather than the loaded page.

The two subquery predicates are guarded by `:noSearchFilter = false`, so Postgres constant-folds
them away when nobody is searching — an unsearched listing plans and costs exactly what it did
before (verified with EXPLAIN: neither `invoice` nor `payment_plan` appears in the plan). While
searching, both are index-driven (`idx_invoice_payment_log_mapping_payment_log_id`, and the
`payment_plan` primary key) and evaluated only over rows that already passed the institute, date
and status filters.

#### Slide-over filters
- **Payment Type**, **Plan Status**, **Payment Source**, **Course / Session**
- Payment status and the date window are deliberately *not* here — they live in the toolbar

### 📋 Payment Logs Table

Displays detailed payment information with the following columns:
- **Date & Time**: Transaction date with relative time display
- **User**: Full name and email of the user
- **Amount**: Formatted currency amount
- **Payment Status**: Current status with color-coded badges
- **Payment Method**: Payment vendor information
- **Plan Status**: User plan status
- **Course/Membership**: Enroll invite name and code
- **Invoice**: Invoice number issued for the payment, with an inline PDF preview
- **Transaction ID**: Payment transaction reference
- **Tracking ID / Tracking Source / Order Status / Actions**: physical-order tracking (hidden by default)
- **Payment Plan**: Plan name and validity period

#### Column layout (`ManageColumnsPopover`)
Every column except **Date & Time** and **Amount** can be switched off — those two are the row,
so their checkbox is ticked and disabled. Columns can also be **dragged into a different order**,
either by the grip in the Manage Column popover or by the grip on the column header itself
(`MyTable`'s opt-in `enableColumnReorder`).

Both choices are per-browser localStorage (`manage-payments:hidden-columns`,
`manage-payments:column-order`) and are reconciled against the columns that actually exist, so a
newly shipped column lands in its natural place rather than at the end of a saved layout, and a
column that only some institutes have (Organization Name) doesn't disturb the rest.

#### Invoice column
The invoice number is **not** part of the payment-logs response. It is resolved for the ~20 rows
on screen via `POST /v1/invoices/by-payment-logs?instituteId=…`, which reads the
`invoice_payment_log_mapping` table the invoice itself was built from — so the number shown is the
one the learner was actually issued, never inferred from amounts or dates. Payment logs with no
invoice render a dash; a voided (REJECTED) invoice renders struck through.

The lookup deliberately returns no PDF URL: presigning is one media-service round trip per file,
so it happens lazily when someone clicks preview (`InvoicePreviewByIdDialog` → the invoice detail
endpoint → the shared `InvoicePreviewDialog`, which renders the real stored PDF). The query is
skipped entirely while the column is hidden, and a failed lookup degrades to dashes rather than
taking the table down.

**Backend-version fallback.** The dashboard and admin_core_service deploy separately, and a local
dev server points at stage by default — so a build routinely runs against a backend that predates
the bulk endpoint. `resolvePaymentLogInvoices` therefore tries the bulk lookup first and, on any
failure, falls back to the long-standing `GET /v1/invoices/user/{userId}?instituteId=…` (one
request per distinct learner on the page), joining on the same `payment_log_ids` the invoice
carries. The number rendered is identical either way; only the request count differs, and the fast
path resumes automatically once the backend ships.

**Raised-but-unpaid invoices are rows too.** Creating an invoice does NOT create a payment log —
one only appears when the learner initiates payment — so an invoice an admin raised used to be
invisible on this screen entirely. The combined listing query therefore has a third UNION arm that
emits such invoices by invoice id, discriminated by a `row_type` column
(`CombinedPaymentRowProjection`). The service loads both kinds, resolves users for both in one
call, and re-emits them in the query's `created_at DESC` order.

These rows carry their invoice inline (`invoice` on the entry), so the Invoice column renders
without any lookup — and the bulk lookup deliberately skips them. They have no `user_plan`, so
every consumer must stay optional-chained (`PaymentDetailSheet` and `resolveEntryCurrency` already
are).

A voided (`REJECTED`) invoice is shown struck through with a `CANCELLED` status and is excluded
from every total by `isCancelledEntry` — cancelled money is neither collected nor owed.

**KPI impact.** Unpaid (non-voided) invoices are also added to the billed side of the billing
summary via a `billed_invoices` CTE, so Total and Due finally include invoice obligations, which
carry no `user_plan` and were previously owed by nobody. Measured on HCCA: Due ₹69,840 → ₹146,440,
Total ₹133,840 → ₹210,440. The rise is smaller than the ₹103,600 raw invoice total because due is
netted per learner — an over-payment elsewhere absorbs part of a new obligation, which is this
query's long-standing (documented) behaviour.

**Still not counted:** an invoice that is only PARTIALLY paid. Its payment logs make it visible as
rows, but its obligation is in neither `billed_plans` (no user_plan) nor `billed_invoices` (it has
payment logs). Widening that would risk double-counting against the `paid` CTE, so it was left
alone deliberately.
