   * signup entry point is an admin hand-adding a Signup button in the
   * catalogue page editor.

 * `signup.enabled: false` has never actually taken effect on a public page.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT consult the legacy `LEARNER_<id>.allowSignup` flag that
 * domain routing writes. The catalogue header has never consulted it, and it is
 * not a trustworthy signal: across prod it is false on 100 rows, null on 11 and
 * true on only 8 — "never configured" rather than "denied". ReadOnRent resolves
 * to `allowSignup: false` on every one of its domains while actively wanting
 * signup, so honouring it here would hide the very button this exists to fix.
 *
 * @param instituteIdOverride pass it when the caller already resolved the
 *        institute (e.g. from `useDomainRouting`) to skip the storage poll.
