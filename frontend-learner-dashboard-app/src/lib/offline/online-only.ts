/**
 * Client-side mirror of the backend's "online-only" slide classification
 * (plan §A1 platform gate / OfflineAssetExtractor): third-party-hosted
 * content and execution environments that are never downloadable, so the
 * learner app must gate them behind a "Requires internet" message when
 * offline rather than attempting (and failing) to load them.
 *
 * This is a best-effort client mirror for UI gating only — the manifest's
 * per-slide `downloadable`/`reason` (see manifest-service.ts) is the
 * authoritative source once a manifest has been fetched for this course.
