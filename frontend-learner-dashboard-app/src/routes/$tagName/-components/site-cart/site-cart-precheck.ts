/**
 * Checkout pre-check: can the store product page sell everything in the cart?
 *
 * The store checkout selects courses by `?courseIds=` (package session ids)
 * and silently drops any id it has no ACTIVE mapping for, and it selects EVERY
 * mapping that matches an id — so a course listed twice on the store page is
 * charged twice. Both are decided here, before the visitor leaves the cart, so
 * an item is never dropped or double-charged without them seeing why.
 *
 * One order is charged in ONE currency (the checkout adds its lines up), so an
 * item priced in another currency than the order's is set aside to be checked
 * out on its own. A price that changed since the item was added (a promo or a
 * product page's own price, against the store's plan) is put in front of the
 * visitor before checkout, never applied silently.
