 * seeding it from one catalogue would leak that catalogue's vocabulary across
 * the whole app for the rest of the browser session. This stays a read-only
 * override scoped to the React tree the catalogue renders.
 *
 * Falls through to the institute's terminology for anything the catalogue does
 * not set, so a catalogue with no `naming` block behaves exactly as before.
 *
 * The words are written in the site's BASE language. A site with languages
 * shows them in another language only where its dictionary translates them;
 * otherwise the institute's term in that language (getTerminology resolves in
 * the site language under CatalogueLocaleProvider) — never an English word on
 * a हिन्दी page.
