 * What a finished assessment card offers the learner.

 * A survey has no marks, so it has neither a report to open nor a result to
 * wait for — but both of the original flags keyed off `result_type`, which on a
 * survey is incidental. The 147 older surveys carry MANUAL (so they showed
 * "Results pending" forever), while a survey created today defaults to
 * AUTO_AFTER_SUBMISSION and would have offered "Show Report" and
 * "Show AI Report" on an unmarked questionnaire.
