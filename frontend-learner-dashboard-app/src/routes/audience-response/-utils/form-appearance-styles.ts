/**
 * Design-token class maps for the audience response page.
 *
 * Tailwind only sees class names it can read literally, so every combination is
 * spelled out here rather than built with `bg-${accent}-100` interpolation —
 * an interpolated class is simply absent from the compiled stylesheet and the
 * element renders unstyled. (See project note: "Tailwind class existence
 * check".)
 *
 * Lives in its own module, not alongside the page component: exporting
 * constants from a component file breaks React Fast Refresh, and both the page
 * and its sub-blocks need these.
 *
 * Reminder for editors — the learner app's primary scale stops at `500`.
 * `primary-600` compiles to nothing here, so accent hovers step to `400`.

 * card from the browser and stay out of the way. Colour belongs on the one
 * primary action, not under the fields people are trying to read.
 *
 * `gradient` is kept for campaigns that deliberately want a branded marketing
 * page. It uses `bg-app-page-wash`, not `bg-app-gradient`: the latter is a
 * single `to bottom right` linear gradient, so all its colour lands in the
 * top-left corner and has washed out by the middle of the page — precisely
 * where the form card sits.
