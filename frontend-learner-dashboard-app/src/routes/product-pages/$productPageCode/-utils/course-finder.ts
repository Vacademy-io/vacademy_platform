 * here parses a course or level name: a page selling one scholarship test per
 * class carries all nine of them under a single level ("Scholarship Test") with
 * the class buried in the course name, so name-derived grouping would produce
 * one group containing everything. `levelNames` exists only for pages that
 * genuinely model a class as a level, and ids win wherever both are set.
 *
 * See the catalogue's CourseFinderWizard for the same idea on a catalogue site;
 * that one groups by level because catalogue levels ARE the classes there.
