 * screen: this is opened by strangers judging a document, and "verified by
 * <institute>" over the institute's mark is the thing that answers their
 * question. See VerifiedByCertificate.
 *
 * <p>Served from the institute's learner portal, so a white-labelled school
 * sends its graduates' verifiers to its own domain — the QR is built as
 * `<learnerPortalBaseUrl>/verify/<number>?t=<token>` in
 * CertificateVerificationService.buildVerificationUrl.
 *
 * Reachable without logging in. `/verify` is in the public-route allowlist in
 * use-domain-routing.ts (both copies), so domain routing does not bounce an
 * anonymous visitor to the courses page.
