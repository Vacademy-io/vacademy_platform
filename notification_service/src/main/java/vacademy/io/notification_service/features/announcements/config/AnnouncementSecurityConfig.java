/**
 * Security configuration documentation for Announcement System APIs
 * 
 * This class serves as documentation for the security configuration of announcement system APIs.
 * The actual security configuration is handled in WebSecurityConfig.java
 * 
 * SECURITY APPROACH:
 * =================
 * 
 * 1. INTERNAL APIs are OPEN (No JWT required):
 *    - All announcement system APIs are designed for inter-service communication
 *    - No JWT token parsing for identification
 *    - User details come from request parameters/body, not from JWT
 *    - This allows other services to create announcements without authentication overhead
 * 
 * 2. ALLOWED PATHS (Open for internal communication):
 *    - /notification-service/v1/announcements/**
 *    - /notification-service/v1/user-messages/**
 *    - /notification-service/v1/message-replies/**
 * 
 * 3. CROSS-SERVICE COMMUNICATION:
 *    - notification_service ← auth_service (user resolution)
 *    - notification_service ← admin_core_service (package session resolution)
 *    - All services → notification_service (create announcements)
 * 
 * 4. REQUEST-BASED IDENTIFICATION:
 *    - instituteId: Provided in request body
 *    - createdBy: User ID provided in request body
 *    - createdByName: User name provided in request body
 *    - createdByRole: User role provided in request body
 *    - No JWT parsing or user context resolution
 * 
 * 5. VALIDATION APPROACH:
 *    - Input validation through @Valid annotations
 *    - Business logic validation in service layer
 *    - No authentication/authorization validation
 *    - Trust-based approach for internal services
 * 
 * EXAMPLE USAGE:
 * ==============
 * 
 * Other services can call announcement APIs directly:
 * 
 * POST /notification-service/v1/announcements
 * {
 *   "title": "New Assignment Posted",
 *   "content": { "type": "html", "content": "<p>Check your assignments</p>" },
 *   "instituteId": "inst123",
 *   "createdBy": "user456",
 *   "createdByName": "John Doe",
 *   "createdByRole": "TEACHER",
 *   "recipients": [
 *     { "recipientType": "PACKAGE_SESSION", "recipientId": "ps789" }
 *   ],
 *   "modes": [
 *     { "modeType": "SYSTEM_ALERT", "settings": {} }
 *   ]
 * }
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ========================
 * 
 * 1. Network Security:
 *    - APIs should be accessible only within the internal network
 *    - Use Kubernetes network policies or similar to restrict access
 *    - Consider VPN or private networking for production
 * 
 * 2. Service Authentication:
 *    - While user authentication is bypassed, consider service-to-service authentication
 *    - API keys or service tokens could be added in future if needed
 *    - Currently relies on network-level security
 * 
 * 3. Input Validation:
 *    - Comprehensive validation prevents malicious input
 *    - Rate limiting should be implemented at infrastructure level
 *    - Request size limits are configured in application properties
 * 
 * 4. Audit Trail:
 *    - All announcement creation is logged
 *    - User interactions (read, dismiss, reply) are tracked
 *    - Delivery status is recorded for each medium
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * ====================
 * 
 * 1. Service Authentication:
 *    - Add API key validation for service-to-service calls
 *    - Implement service registry and discovery
 * 
 * 2. Rate Limiting:
 *    - Per-service rate limiting
 *    - Per-institute rate limiting
 * 
 * 3. Enhanced Monitoring:
 *    - Security event logging
 *    - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
