# Vacademy AI Voice Bot Service


The dedicated real-time voice-bot behind the **Vacademy AI Agent** provider
(`VACADEMY_AI`). Productionization of the validated POC
(<https://github.com/shreyash-jain/sales-poc-ai>): Plivo `<Stream>` WebSocket →
Pipecat pipeline (Silero VAD → Sarvam Saaras STT → Sarvam-M LLM → Sarvam Bulbul
TTS) → same socket back to the caller.

**Stateless by design** — no database. Per-call context comes from admin_core's
internal API; the end-of-call report goes to the generic AI-voice webhook, which
drives the entire existing outcome pipeline (disposition → assign/stop/retry →
workflow resume → Call Intelligence). Design doc:
`../docs/crm/VACADEMY_AI_AGENT.md`.

## Call flow

```
admin_core VacademyAiOutboundCaller ──► Plivo Call API (answer_url = /answer)
lead answers ──► Plivo GET /answer ──► XML: [<Record recordSession>] <Stream wss:/ws> <Redirect ai-next>
Plivo WS ──► /ws: parse handshake → fetch call-context (persona+lead+handoff+token)
          ──► Pipecat pipeline runs the conversation
LLM appends <<END_CALL>> / <<TRANSFER>> → SentinelGate strips it, stops after the last utterance
   transfer: POST /internal/voice-bot/handoff, close stream → Plivo <Redirect> → <Dial> team member
call ends ──► analysis LLM call → report JSON → POST /webhook/ai-voice/VACADEMY_AI
```

## Run locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill SARVAM_API_KEY etc.; export or use dotenv
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8090
ngrok http --region in 8090      # PUBLIC_HOST=<ngrok host>
```

Then set `VOICE_BOT_BASE_URL=https://<ngrok host>` on admin_core and place an AI
call (`POST /v1/telephony/ai-call/connect` with `"provider":"VACADEMY_AI"`).

## Room tone (office ambience)

Every call has a low-level office ambience loop mixed under the outbound audio
so silence between turns never sounds like a dead digital line. The asset is
`assets/call_center_ambience_8k_mono.wav` (8 kHz, mono, 16-bit PCM, 78.5 s
seamless loop, −32 dBFS RMS — converted from a 44.1 kHz stereo call-centre
ambience recording: anti-aliased downsample, mono downmix, 1.5 s crossfade at
the loop seam, normalised) — it must stay 8 kHz mono because pipecat's mixer does not
resample. It is mixed inside the output transport (`app/ambience.py`, pipecat
`SoundfileMixer`), so STT/LLM/TTS are untouched.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AMBIENCE_ENABLED` | `true` | `false` removes the mixer entirely — no code change needed |
| `AMBIENCE_VOLUME` | `0.15` | mixer gain on the file (0.15 × −32 dBFS ≈ −48 dBFS); ducked to 0.6× while the bot speaks |
| `AMBIENCE_DRIFT_DB` | `2.0` | slow ± level drift so the bed breathes like a room; `0` holds it flat |
| `AMBIENCE_DRIFT_PERIOD_SECS` | `40` | one drift cycle; the phase is randomised per call |

## Telephone-band EQ on the bot's voice

Measured on the production path: our TTS carries **30.8%** of its energy below
300 Hz against **15.3%** for a real recording through real microphones — a
caller's handset and the analog hybrid roll that band off, ours does not. The
result is one band-limited voice and one full-range, close-miked voice on the
same line, which is the strongest remaining "this is a recording" cue.
`app/voice_eq.py` puts the bot in the caller's band (300 Hz high-pass, gentle
3.4 kHz low-pass, small presence lift, makeup gain), as a processor between
`DuckGate` and `transport.output()` — so it also covers TTS-cache hits and
scripted lines, and cannot touch the ambience, which is mixed in afterwards.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VOICE_EQ_ENABLED` | `true` | `false` removes the processor entirely |
| `VOICE_EQ_HIGHPASS_HZ` | `300` | the telephone channel's low corner |
| `VOICE_EQ_PRESENCE_DB` | `2.5` | lift at 1.7 kHz, wins back what the high-pass costs |
| `VOICE_EQ_MAKEUP_DB` | `2.0` | returns the ~3 dB the high-pass removes (measured peak after: −4.5 dBFS) |

Measured effect on 13.3 s of production speech: sub-300 Hz energy 30.8% → 18.4%,
in-band 68.3% → 81.2% — i.e. it lands on the real-recording profile.

## Voice modulation (pitch-range expansion), any engine

Clients: "the tone is very simple and linear — bot like". The TTS engines expose
no usable prosody control (Smallest: speed only), so `app/prosody.py` reshapes
the **audio**: it tracks the pitch of each block and scales every excursion
around the voice's own running median by a factor, resynthesised with Praat's
PSOLA (`praat-parselmouth`). The voice keeps its identity; it just moves more.
Streamed in 200 ms blocks with 60 ms of context and a 20 ms cross-fade, so first
audio is delayed ~260 ms; the tail of a sentence is flushed on `TTSStoppedFrame`
or after 80 ms without audio; an interruption drops what is pending. Sits
between `DuckGate` and the EQ (shape full-band, then band-limit).

Measured on real Smallest/mrunal output (pitch spread, sd of F0 in semitones;
conversational speech is ~4–5 st): English 2.9 → 3.6 / 3.9 / 4.3 and Hindi
3.4 → 4.1 / 4.7 / 5.7 at ×1.3 / ×1.6 / ×2.0; every variant transcribed
word-for-word; ~0.013× realtime on one core.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PROSODY_EXPAND` | `1.0` (off) | box default and kill switch; `1.6` = conversational, `2.5` max |
| agent `voiceModulation` (dashboard, V504) | unset | per-agent override — the intended rollout path: one agent, one listening test, then widen |

If STT ever transcribes the ambience via handset echo, lower `AMBIENCE_VOLUME`
rather than adding filtering.

## Ops checklist

- Deploy in **ap-south-1** (Plivo India media anchoring), public **WSS** ingress.
- Register `voice_bot_service` in admin_core's `client_secret_key` table; set
  `VOICE_BOT_CLIENT_NAME`/`VOICE_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET` here.
- Set `VOICE_BOT_BASE_URL` on admin_core (else the provider refuses to dial).
- Institute prerequisites: Vacademy Voice (PLIVO) telephony config active, and
  `AI_CALLING_SETTING.provider = VACADEMY_AI`.

## Pipecat version note

`requirements.txt` pins **pipecat-ai 0.0.95** — every module path this service
imports was verified against that wheel (Sarvam STT first shipped in 0.0.93;
0.0.79 lacks it entirely; the 1.x line moved the transports package). If you
bump the pin, re-verify each import in `app/bot.py` / `app/main.py` /
`app/providers.py`, and re-check two constructor contracts: `SarvamTTSService`
(requires `aiohttp_session`) and `PlivoFrameSerializer.InputParams(auto_hang_up=
False)` — auto-hangup MUST stay off or the `<Redirect>` handoff can never fire.

## Security hardening (recommended before broad rollout)

- **Restrict `/ws` + `/answer` to Plivo's published source-IP ranges** at the
  ingress/load balancer — all legitimate traffic originates from Plivo; this
  blocks replay of leaked `corr` ids (which would otherwise drive real
  STT/LLM/TTS spend).
- Set a **webhook secret** (institute-level in the AI Calling config, or the
  global `AAVTAAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) so end-of-call report POSTs are
  authenticated; without one, the receiver accepts unauthenticated reports
  (same open-mode posture as Aavtaar today).

## Conversation simulator (`sim/`) — test calls without TTS or STT

Twelve scripted callers, each one a real caller we failed in the week of
2026-09-08 (the greeter who says "good morning" back, "cut the call", all-offline,
the permanent Meet link, the price-pusher, "day after tomorrow", the Hindi switcher,
wrong number, the bare "Yes", "just WhatsApp me", the busy teacher, the objector),
are played by a cheap LLM against the **real agent prompt** (`build_system_prompt`
on a saved call context), the **real production LLM**, and the **real text gates**
(SentinelGate marker/tool-call handling, NoRepeatGate). TTS and STT are replaced by
text, so a full run costs LLM tokens only (~₹6). What the caller would have heard is
graded by hard rules (re-greet, not ending when asked, spoken markup, full name,
invented price or time, wrong weekday, Hindi not kept, online pitch after "all
offline"…) plus a judge score for "did it listen".

```
docker compose exec voice-bot python -m sim.run                     # prod model, all personas
python -m sim.run --model sarvam:sarvam-105b --reps 3               # any model spec (see sim/llm.py)
python -m sim.run --agent <ai_agent id>                             # a live agent's real context
python -m sim.run --ci                                              # exit 1 on a hard fail
```

It runs in CI after the unit harness (`Run conversation simulator`) and blocks the
deploy on a hard fail; the JSON report is an artifact. **Run it before any model,
voice, prompt-rule or turn-taking change** — that is the whole point. Not covered:
how the voice sounds, real line acoustics, STT mishearings (listen to recordings).
