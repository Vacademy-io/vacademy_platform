"""Per-call technical diagnostics — collection, and a PURE health verdict.

Why this exists: diagnosing three founder-flagged calls in 2026-07 took a
forensic sweep of ~140k log lines across 220 calls on the box. Every signal that
investigation needed was already known to this process at call time; it was just
never carried anywhere. This module carries it, so the next "the agent took ages
and I had to repeat myself" is a hover in the admin UI, not an SSH session.

Design mirrors app/callstate.py deliberately:
  * a plain dataclass of counters (no pipecat imports, no I/O),
  * PURE functions (``verdict``) the scripted harness can drive,
  * a TOTAL ``to_payload()`` that can never raise into the report path.

Cost discipline: this runs on a 1-vCPU box carrying live calls. Everything here
is per-TURN or per-EVENT — never per audio frame — and every reservoir is
bounded, so a 10-minute call cannot produce megabytes.

Honesty discipline: a signal we could not measure is ``None``, NEVER 0. Reading
"0 answers deleted" when we actually went blind is how a fleet chart says "fixed"
about something that isn't; that mistake is exactly what this module exists to
prevent. ``src`` marks whether a fault is MEASURED or INFERRED.

# bot.set_user_speaking. Compare DEAD_AIR rates across the v3/v4 boundary with care.
# v5 (2026-08-14): greetings/address terms and bare function words are no longer
# ANSWER_DELETED. "Hello." x15 and "Hi." x10 were 23% of all reported losses over
# the 7 days to 2026-08-14, and the fault fired on 60% of current-build calls while
# ~76% of its payload was social tokens or abandoned fragments. Consent and refusal

# "वो।" — one syllable, no answer in it, dropped when the reply it landed on top
# of was cancelled. Reported to a human as "1 answer never reached the agent",
# which sent them looking for a lost answer that was never spoken.
#
# It is STRUCTURAL, not bad luck. _norm_answer keeps only alphanumerics and
# Devanagari combining vowels are not alphanumeric, so "वो।" normalizes to the
# single char "व" — below _CONTAIN_MIN_CHARS, which turns pass 2 off. Below that
# floor a final can never be matched, so the guard that exists to prevent a false
# MATCH had become a guaranteed false FAULT: any sub-floor scrap the aggregator
# dropped was certain to be counted as a deleted answer.

# and changes the call — "absorb but never lose" exists for exactly that — and so

    Returns a ``Lost``: the losses that carried something (ANSWER_DELETED's
    input) and the sub-floor scraps that did not (evidence only — see

    of the 2026-07 forensics: pipecat's aggregator DELETES caller utterances

    reach the transcript and the report: ``heard`` is derived from
    outcome.transcript, which report.py posts verbatim — so UI copy claiming
    otherwise is wrong.)

    Two passes:
    1. Multiset exact match, so a genuine repeat ("SSC." twice) is not miscounted.
    2. CONTAINMENT with consumption: Saaras splits one halting utterance into
       fragment finals ("नहीं जान।" + "सकते हैं आप।") which the aggregator JOINS
       into one context message — per-final exact matching then counted every
       fragment as deleted. Live call ae7d3069 reported 10 deletions on a
       conversation the model demonstrably followed (it answered each refusal).
