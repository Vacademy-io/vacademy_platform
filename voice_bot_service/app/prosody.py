"""Voice modulation for the bot's OWN voice — vendor-agnostic.

Clients, 2026-09-11: "the tone is very simple and linear — bot like". Our TTS
(Smallest lightning_v3.1_pro) exposes no prosody control beyond speed, the
founder rejected the one Smallest voice with a wider pitch range, and the ask
was for something that does not depend on the engine at all. So this works on
the AUDIO: track the pitch of each block, and scale every excursion above and
below the voice's own median by ``expand`` (in the log/semitone domain, so the
voice keeps its identity — it just moves more). Resynthesis is Praat's PSOLA
(praat-parselmouth), the standard phonetics tool for exactly this edit.

Measured on real Smallest/mrunal output (pitch spread = sd of F0 in semitones
around the median; conversational human speech sits around 4–5 st):

    expand      1.0     1.3     1.6     2.0
    English     2.9     3.6     3.9     4.3
    Hindi       3.4     4.1     4.7     5.7

Every variant transcribed word-for-word through Sarvam STT, and the whole thing
runs at ~0.04x realtime on the 1-vCPU Mumbai box.

STREAMING. TTS audio arrives in small frames and must not wait for a sentence.
Blocks of ``block_ms`` are shaped with ``context_ms`` of real audio on each
side (pitch tracking needs ~3 periods of context; PSOLA needs it not to start
at a cut), and consecutive blocks are cross-faded over ``xfade_ms`` so the seam
never clicks. First audio is therefore delayed by block + context (~260 ms).
A sentence's tail is flushed on TTSStoppedFrame, and — because that frame is
a vendor promise, not a guarantee — also when no audio has arrived for
``idle_flush_secs``; an interruption drops whatever is pending.

The median is a RUNNING estimate over the whole call (not per block): a block's
own median is part of the movement we want to expand, and centring on it would
flatten the slow declination a sentence naturally has. Until enough pitch has
been seen the block's own median is used.

The DSP (ProsodyShaper) is free of pipecat so it can be tested on synthetic
signals; make_prosody_processor is the thin frame glue, mirroring voice_eq.
