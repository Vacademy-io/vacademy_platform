"""Replay a LIVE call through the real pipeline and check invariants.

Every call logs one line at its end — `replay corr=<id> {json}` — with the
STT finals, VAD on/off, bot audio on/off and the model's raw replies. This
turns that record into a timing-sim scenario (the real pipeline, stub STT
emitting the recorded finals at the recorded times, stub LLM answering with
the recorded replies in order) and runs a fixed set of invariants over what
the pipeline did with it. Production produces conversation shapes nobody
writes down by hand; this makes every call a regression test.

On the box:
    C=<corr>; journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=voice-bot-voice-bot-1 -o cat --since "1 day ago" \
      | grep -a "app.bot replay corr=$C" | sed -E 's/.*corr=[^ ]* //' > /tmp/probe/replay_$C.json
    docker run --rm --env-file .env -v /tmp/probe/replay_$C.json:/srv/rec.json:ro $IMG \
      python -m sim.replay --file rec.json --corr $C [--verbose]
`--corr` fetches the agent context from admin-core (the record is not enough
to rebuild the prompt); without network, `--context <json>` takes a fixture.
`--dir <folder>` replays every *.json in it and prints one line per call.
