"""Phase 2 of the simulator: TIMING. Runs the REAL pipeline — run_bot with its
gates, aggregator, VAD, Smart Turn, watchdog — on a simulated phone line, with
stub STT/LLM/TTS services that behave like vendors (latency, streaming) but cost
nothing. Real speech audio (sim/fixtures/caller_speech_8k.wav, one TTS render)
drives the VAD, so barge-in, ducking, held tails, resumes, nudges and closes all
happen the way they do on a call.

    docker compose exec voice-bot python -m sim.timing            # all scenarios
    python -m sim.timing --scenarios yes_over_tail,silent_caller --verbose

Each scenario scripts the caller (what, when — absolute or relative to the bot's
k-th utterance) and the model's replies, then asserts on what the LINE carried:
bot audio intervals, the played transcript, the diagnostics. Not covered:
STT accuracy (the stub transcribes perfectly), audio quality, vendor outages."""
